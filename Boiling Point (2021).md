SPOILERS: The ending and other clues. I couldn't find anywhere decent discussion of the plot and especially the ending seems to be misunderstood by almost everyone. This is a complicated thriller, not only kitchen drama (which side I am mostly skipping here).

## Substance use
Andy died of a cardiac arrest after he snorted heroin thinking it was cocaine. He doesn't choke to death, we hear him having a final troubled breath as the screen fades to black.

Cocaine is absolutely pure white but what we see him snorting seems to be slightly darker, like street heroin would be (depending on type and cuts). It is hard to see but the frame is filled with white drinking bottle, papers and shirt, I believe intentionally put there to show us this subtle hint.

The mix-up at 0h43. Holly (the dealer) and Jake: - What'd you want, heroin, wasn't it? - Yes, yea, yea. Henry's sick. - Eighth? - Yes.

Henry is slang for 1/8 oz of any drug. Jake smoked a joint and Holly is speaking unclearly (subtitles actually make her say henry too). Holly was occupied with her phone (mix-up with different customers' orders?). Jake agreed to heroin and 1/8 oz, thinking he had agreed to a large bag of cocaine.

- 0h44 Jake walks towards Andy's office, while noting to Andy that he did the bins (code for getting drugs).
    
- 0h50 Jake and two others of the kitchen staff are very high. Presumably they all took lines in Andy's office, and left the rest on the table.
    

Why did the three only get totally wasted but Andy died? Cocaine and heroin in combination cause sudden cardiac arrests, and it seems that Andy also did cocaine from old stash but we only get subtle clues:

- 0h18 A very miserable Andy tells Carly he's feeling bad, cannot work and even his knives are missing.
    
- 0h20 Andy seems to reach for something under the counter while talking with Tony, one of the drug users. Camille sees it and gives Andy an odd look. Andy immediately goes to the back but his son calls. Robin arrives to work late and the camera follows her and Andrea serving table 7 for quite some time.
    
- 0h25 We return to Andy on front kitchen and Carly asks how his son was, and he seems a bit upset about that at first. He is smiling and working diligently for the first time, knives found.
    
- 0h30 Jake has finally arrived but where is Andy coming from? He is real sunshine with everyone, the dishwasher gets upset with him "having fun".
    
- 0h31 Andy asks Jake to order more drugs (get the bins sorted out). Beth (owner's daughter) gives Andy hard time for being missing.
    
- 0h35 Andy sneezing multiple times, clearly snorted something earlier.
    

Andy's call with his son Nate couldn't have gone well and he first seems upset when Carly asks about it. If he had old stash (possibly from under that counter), he could have taken some while we watched table 7. Probably took another while the pie filling was being fixed, before Jake arrived.

The bar also serves special coffees, presumably with booze in it. Chef's coffee, double, extra strong (I think I heard someone needing a triple at some point too).

## Table 13
You are led to believe early on that the nut allergy is the main thriller. Table 13 is very central to the movie but not because of that allergic reaction.

The real killer is that the woman's EpiPen would've saved Andy, if it she wasn't already taken away because of her allergic reaction for which two EpiPens were used (but only the ER team epi shot is shown, so listen closely to that dialogue at 1h14). At the end, the chef collapses very near that table.

- 0h32m table number mix-ups? Tables 14, 13 and 7 appear in quick succession. The kitchen is informed of the allergy and Carly announces it to everyone. Andy and Camille (French girl) clearly hear the correct table number.
    
- 1h00 the fatal dish:
    
    - Andy and Freeman are conversing in the background when Carly calls table 13 no nuts main dishes. Andy hears Carly talking with Beth about table 7.
        
    - Camille says she's out of house dressing and Andy while busy with his own sause goes over to help. Andy tells Camille to use the other dressing on one of the plates.
        
    - Andy doesn't know they are working on table 13. Camille heard the call for table 13 but didn't realize that the other dressing contains walnut oil, or that this is nuts, as revealed at 1h18 and then Freeman calls out Andy as the culprit and Andy takes the blame.
        

The health inspector and chef also sit down on that particular table. A knife falls to the floor and the inspector notes that it'll have to be replaced (and isn't replaced). Another red herring for those following the allergy story closely.

The staff meeting before the restaurant opens is also held on that same table. Freeman gives Beth the finger on her group selfie but Emily pushes it away and they don't know if that got on the picture (you'll find it out after the end credits).

## Side dramas
- Carly keeps everything together and running. She has a job offer from another restaurant but must make the decision on that night. Andy has asked Beth for her requested pay raise but Beth doesn't understand it is urgent, and Andy's promises once more are useless. Alistair extorts Andy to fire Carly so she can be blamed for the allergy episode. At 1h20 while Alistair is eavesdropping Carly makes almost a monologue sounding like she is getting fired while actually she will stay - if I understood it and the whispers correctly). She cannot save Andy at the end but will have another job at least when the restaurant certainly goes under.
    
- Andy's family (interrupted calls, 0h21 Nate calls and all seems good but we don't hear how it ends, 0h49 call to Nate is rejected, 1h24 call to ex who catches his obvious lies about not being drunk and sniffing, and convinces him to rehab; he throws away the booze and drugs, even tries to clear his nostrils, but he is already fatally OD'd)
    
- Emily finding out that her son cuts himself 0h28 lovely short emotional act as they fix the cake dressing. Andy's opinion of that may have been affected by him snorting coke meanwhile.
    
- Alistair and Mary (Alistair extorts Andy to make him a partner in this restaurant, and to fire Carly to save it; everyone else admires Alistair as a talented TV chef while Andy suffers alone with him being a real brick; Alistair's own business is going under, and once Andy dies he cannot have the money or his restaurant either; against expectations Mary is friendly to all)
    
- Beth being very much over her head in the job and clearly hated by her staff despite her all-loving attitude, gets it from Carly 0h52 and from Freeman 1h19. In between she deals with the racist customer on table 7 and asks their waitress Andrea and chef Carly each out for a drink, likely to make up for the mistakes she's made (shouldn't have put Andrea to the table already served by Robin who also had nothing to do; and shouldn't have allowed that steak order to the already overloaded kitchen).
