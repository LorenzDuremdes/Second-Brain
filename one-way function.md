1. one-way function; a function that is easy to compute on every input, but hard to invert given the image of a random input
	
	here, "easy" and "hard" are to be understood in the sense of [[computational complexity]] theory, specifically the theory of polynomial time problems^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function]
	
	e.g. it's easier multiplying 2 prime numbers than finding out the multiple prime numbers making up a number^[Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions, p. 198]
