1. “The pendulum of the [[mind]] alternates between sense and nonsense, not between right and wrong.” - Carl Jung
2. They're people just like all of us, the only difference is circumstance. In fact, if most of you all were put in the same context, most of you could probably have tossed a baby into a fire as well.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/MorbidReality/comments/w73sej/comment/ihhuhew/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
	1. I think understanding we could all potentially be this bad is the first step to making sure we don't get this bad.

1. nurture (trainability) vs. nature ('natural advantage')
   
   You’d think that would be a natural advantage, and it can be. Former British Cycling head physio Phil Burt says: “Geraint Thomas is the kid in the playground who is good at everything. He could have succeeded at a range of sports; he’s naturally fit and was an excellent cyclist from the day he started.” And just look how good Thomas became.
   
   However, Bouchard also discovered that some individuals who start out with a high VO2max don’t improve as much as the high-responders. It was often the better responders who ended up with a higher trained VO2max than the naturally talented. That’s why I put trainability ahead of natural ability. Bouchard’s research group has samples of [[DNA]] from 300 endurance athletes with very high VO2max scores and, based on their [[gene]] variants, none of them is at the low end of the responder spectrum.
   
   But where does that leave the best? The [[probability]] that a person starts out with a high VO2max and is also highly trainable is a very rare combination. The geneticist Alun Williams and his team identified 23 [[gene]] variants – there may be more – strongly linked with endurance talent. Some of these variants were discovered in 80 per cent of people they tested, others in fewer than five per cent. The crunch came when Williams ran the statistical algorithm on his computer and found the odds of a single person possessing the perfect set of [[gene]] variants, which includes those related to trainability, as one in a quadrillion (that’s a number with 15 zeros).
   
   But what about the best? It’s a reasonable hypothesis that they are in that top 15 per cent of the population with exceptional trainability. Around all of the cycling’s true greats, you hear stories of how rapidly their fitness improves in response to training. They recover from training sessions faster than team-mates, which allows them to take on much bigger training loads, and the bigger the training load, the more it boosts fitness – it’s a positive cycle. The greats of cycling are all super-responders.^[[What separates the best...from the rest? | Cycling Weekly](https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/what-separates-the-best-from-the-rest-2-498100)]
