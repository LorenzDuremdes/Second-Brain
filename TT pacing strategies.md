# preparation
1. how do you like to estimate how fast (average [[speed]]) you can go?
	1. plug a course in [[myWindsock]] > put in the headwind (and elevation%) inÂ [An interactive model-based calculator of cycling power vs. speed (gribble.org)](https://gribble.org/cycling/power_v_speed.html) > and the watts you are aiming for > try to get the same average speed in myWindsock

# intra-workout
## top tube
1. how do you like to differentiate segments (e.g. city-to-city)?
	1. with a line between the numbers
2. 100 = all out (dFRC)
3. 0 = < Z2
4. n+ = you might be able to go faster (e.g. due to coverage e.g. trees) as [[myWindsock]] doesn't account for such things (yet ~2024)

# execution
1. how can you know via myWindsock that the weather changed (e.g. stronger headwind) after already having prepared the pacing on the top tube?
	1. if it recommends higher/lower speeds at the chosen intervals (or average speed (at a segment)
