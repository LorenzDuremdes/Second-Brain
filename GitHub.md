1. how to search files when above the 1,000 file limit? (Sorry, we had to truncate this directory to 1,000 files. 13 entries were omitted from the list.)
	1. "Go to file" in a repository
2. max repo size (GitHub) = hard limit of 100 GB^[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38768454/repository-size-limits-for-github-com]
3. solve "could not find Git (Git LFS)"
	1. you need to install Git in addition to Github desktop! https://gitforwindows.org/ ^[https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/discussions/5031]
