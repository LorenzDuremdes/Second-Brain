Consumption of 500 mL (18 imp fl oz; 17 US fl oz) of water 30 minutes before meals has been correlated with modest weight loss (1–2 kg; 2.2–4.4 lb) in obese men and women over a period of 8 to 12 weeks.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorectic]

   The fiber you're talking about really helped me. Especially at night time when i couldn't sleep cause i was hungry but i knew i didnt need to eat . It was like a mental thing that if i didn't eat, I didnt sleep. Took a couple before bed to make my tummy stop rumbling and feeling "empty". It really helped me stop eating outside of meal time. It makes you feel full or like youve eaten a snack and its gotten easier to ignore the "empty" feeling in my stomach. ^[https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/131nkam/thoughts_on_dietary_fiber_supplements_for_weight/]
