1. appetite (main components): [[palatability]] and [[satiety]]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatability#Satiety_and_palatability]
	1. higher [[palatability]] decreases appetite slower
2. [[palatability]] is part of the positive feedback loop and satiation is a negative feedback loop^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatability#Satiety_and_palatability]

# macronutrition
1. [[fat]] vs. [[protein]] ([[satiety]])
	1. when compared to high-[[fat]] snacks, eating less energy dense, high-[[protein]] snacks like [[yogurt]] improves appetite control, [[satiety]], and reduces subsequent [[food]] intake in healthy [[women]]^[[Effects of high-protein vs. high- fat snacks on appetite control, [[satiety]], and eating initiation in healthy women | Nutrition Journal | Full Text (biomedcentral.com)](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2891-13-97)]
	2. [[fat]] can provide more long-term [[satiety]] (see: [[gastric emptying]])?

# appetite suppressants
1. [[intermittent fasting]]
2. [[dietary fiber]]
3. Drinking water prior to each meal may help in appetite suppression. Consumption of 500 mL (18 imp fl oz; 17 US fl oz) of water 30 minutes before meals has been correlated with modest weight loss (1–2 kg; 2.2–4.4 lb) in obese men and women over a period of 8 to 12 weeks.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorectic]
4. psyllium^[https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/fiber-and-belly-fat]
   
   The fiber you're talking about really helped me. Especially at night time when i couldn't sleep cause i was hungry but i knew i didnt need to eat . It was like a mental thing that if i didn't eat, I didnt sleep. Took a couple before bed to make my tummy stop rumbling and feeling "empty". It really helped me stop eating outside of meal time. It makes you feel full or like youve eaten a snack and its gotten easier to ignore the "empty" feeling in my stomach. ^[https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/131nkam/thoughts_on_dietary_fiber_supplements_for_weight/]
5. some physical activity e.g. 5m light walking
	1. Refined carbs are digested quickly and converted into glucose, which could lead to rapid spikes in your blood sugar. This leads to increased levels of insulin, a hormone responsible for transporting sugar into your cells.
	   
	   Insulin removes sugar from your blood, which may lead to a sudden drop in blood sugar levels. This signals your body that it needs more food.^[[14 Reasons Why You’re Always Hungry, healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/14-reasons-always-hungry#refined-carbs)]
6. [[tea]]
	1. It is presupposed that tea molecules reduce [[adipose tissue|fat stores]] through several pathways (Huang et al. 2014, Pan et al. 2016, Yang et al. 2016, Rothenberg et al. 2018, Silvester et al. 2018, Willems et al. 2018)^[[The Anti-Obesity and Health-Promoting Effects of Tea and Coffee (2021)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8820582/)]:
		- they influence neuroendocrine metabolic regulators of appetite and reduce food consumption (Huang et al. 2014),
		- they reduce emulsion and absorption of lipids and protein in gastrointestinal system and consequently reduce calorie intake (Huang et al. 2014, Pan et al. 2016)
