1. is the gut trainable e.g. high-[[carbohydrate]] absorption?
	1. A substantial body of evidence suggests that the GI system is highly adaptable. [[Gastric emptying]] as well as stomach comfort can be “trained” and perceptions of fullness decreased; some studies have suggested that nutrient-specific increases in [[gastric emptying]] may occur. Evidence also shows that diet has an impact on the capacity of the intestine to absorb nutrients. Again, the adaptations that occur appear to be nutrient specific. For example, a high-[[carbohydrate]] diet will increase the density of [[sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter|sodium-dependent glucose cotransporters]] in the intestine as well as the activity of the transporter, allowing greater [[carbohydrate]] absorption and oxidation during exercise. It is also likely that, when such adaptations occur, the chances of developing GI distress are smaller.
	   
	   It is clear that “nutritional training” can improve [[gastric emptying]] and absorption and likely reduce the chances and/or severity of GI problems, thereby improving endurance performance as well as providing a better experience for the athlete. The gut is an important organ for endurance athletes and should be trained for the conditions in which it will be required to function.^[[Training the Gut for Athletes | Sports Medicine (springer.com)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-017-0690-6)]
