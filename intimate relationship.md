1. the tendency to reciprocate positive affect may also be greater in unhappy than in happy couples^[The science of [[trust]]: emotional attunement for couples, p. 459]
	1. one way of summarizing this result is to say that there is generally more time linkage or temporal structure in the interaction of distressed marriages and families

## 1:20 ratio
1. What I see a lot in my practice is that couples usually do love, respect, and appreciate one another but neither partner actually _feels_ this in the relationship. Often this is because there is not enough positivity in the relationship. Dr. Gottman’s research on thousands of couples showed, for your partner to _feel_ loved, respected, and appreciated, there must be 20 positive interactions for any one negative interaction.^[https://www.gottman.com/blog/fondness-admiration-and-intimacy/]
	1. This means that every time you accidentally hurt your partner’s feelings, miss a bid, or have an otherwise tense moment in the relationship, you will need to balance that with 20 positive interactions for your partner to continue to feel loved, respected, and admired. (Editor’s Note: the other commonly referenced ratio is 5:1, which applies specifically to interactions within conflict—learn more here)
	2. there are many ways of minmaxing, e.g.:
		1. compliments
		2. positive bids
2. why is the "1:20 ratio (intimate relationship)" so 'high'?^[https://www.gottman.com/blog/fondness-admiration-and-intimacy/]
	1. the [[brain]] is wired to notice and respond to the negative. It is necessary for survival. What this means in relationships is that any negative interaction you have with your partner will stick out in your [[mind]].

1. an **introvert** [[dating]]/having a romantic relationship with an extravert can lead to a mismatch in intimacy needs

	I'm pretty introverted. My first divorce was from being married to an extrovert wherein our levels of socialization needs directly led to 90% of our troubles. Thankfully it led to an easy divorce cause we simply both knew we didn't match and grew apart as we matured.

	Now I'm married to someone who loves being alone just as much as I do and the relationship is always smooth and were both happy. Introverts- in my personal experience don't believe the opposites attract saying.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/qsofs4/comment/hkg47tm/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
1. why are mistrust and betrayal more likely to occur in marriages in which the husband has more power than his wife?^[The science of [[trust]]: emotional attunement for couples, p. 468]
	1. evolutionarily? e.g. female extending "[[courtship]]" to estimate e.g. the male's trustworthiness

## conflict
1. the woman is mostly responsible (involuntarily i.e. [[biology]]) for the down-regulation of the [[limbic system]] [[stress]] responses (i.e. freeze, flight, or fight)^[The science of [[trust]]: emotional attunement for couples, 153]
	1. how? the more the woman has [[trust]] in the man, the more down-regulation
	2. why?
		1. probably because it enables her to exhibit a wider range of behavior (due to her having more [[trust]] in him)
		2. a higher [[trust]] is often justified (e.g. you usually don't [[trust]] a partner as much who's abusive)
		3. tend-and-befriend → [[women]] show a lowering of cortisol than [[men]] during [[stress]]

# processes
1. happy vs. unhappy couples → [[information]] pool^[The science of [[trust]]: emotional attunement for couples, p. 459]
	1. there is more new [[information]] in every behavior in well-functioning family [[system]]
		1. the system is also more flexible because it is less time-locked
