1. Melatonin produced in an ‘unregulated’ fashion is marketed in **dose ranges from 0.3 to 3 mg. Most doses in this range have been shown to have equivalent resetting effects on the [[circadian rhythm]]**. When using exogeneous melatonin, diminished efficacy appears with doses of 10 mg or more in the treatment of intrinsic disorders of the light–dark cycle [5,6,7￭￭]. Pharmacokinetic data have shown that even low doses of melatonin at 0.5–1 mg may result in supraphysiological levels in the body.^[[The use and misuse of exogenous melatonin in the treatment of sleep disorders](https://sci-hub.se/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30148726/), 2018]
2. The greatest advancement can be observed when melatonin is **administered 5 hours prior to both the traditionally determined DLMO** (circadian time 9) and the threshold-determined [[dim light melatonin onset|DLMO]]. Delays are registered when melatonin is administered between 6 to 15 hours after DLMO.^[[The Use of Exogenous Melatonin in Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder: A Meta-analysis - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2982730/)]
3. melatonin has a low bioavailability
	1. From a pharmacokinetic point of view, melatonin is subject to [[hepatic]] [[metabolism]]: its poor adsorption and substantial [[hepatic]] first pass [[metabolism]] explain the low bioavailability of this [[molecule]]. Melatonin is also metabolized in 6-sulfatoxy-melatonin and then excreted in the [[urine]]^[https://annals-general-psychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12991-022-00390-6#ref-CR33]^[https://annals-general-psychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12991-022-00390-6#ref-CR34]^[https://annals-general-psychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12991-022-00390-6#ref-CR35]^[Biological correlates of altered circadian rhythms, autonomic functions and sleep problems in autism spectrum disorder | Annals of General Psychiatry | Full Text (biomedcentral.com)]
