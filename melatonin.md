1. melatonin has a low bioavailability
	1. From a pharmacokinetic point of view, melatonin is subject to [[hepatic]] [[metabolism]]: its poor adsorption and substantial [[hepatic]] first pass [[metabolism]] explain the low bioavailability of this [[molecule]]. Melatonin is also metabolized in 6-sulfatoxy-melatonin and then excreted in the [[urine]]^[https://annals-general-psychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12991-022-00390-6#ref-CR33]^[https://annals-general-psychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12991-022-00390-6#ref-CR34]^[https://annals-general-psychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12991-022-00390-6#ref-CR35]^[Biological correlates of altered circadian rhythms, autonomic functions and sleep problems in autism spectrum disorder | Annals of General Psychiatry | Full Text (biomedcentral.com)]
