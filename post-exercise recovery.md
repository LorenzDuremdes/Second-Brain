# nutrition
1. [[carbohydrate]] intake post-workout
	1. 1–1.2g of carbohydrates per kilogram of body mass per hour for 4 hours post-workout^[https://cyclingtips.com/2018/08/your-guide-to-post-ride-recovery-nutrition-part-1-refuelling/]^[https://road.cc/content/feature/7-tips-maximise-your-recovery-and-build-your-fitness-281827]
2. what causes increased [[carbohydrate]] uptake by [[skeletal muscle|muscles]]?^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 264]
	1. during exercise a special population of these proteins moves to the surface of the muscle that is working, and they help bring [[carbohydrate]] into the working muscle (they stay on the surface of the muscle for up to four hours following the workout)
	2. insulin → acts on the muscle to recruit a second separate population of these proteins to the surface of the muscle
		1. so, you then have two separate populations of these proteins available to bring [[carbohydrate]] into the muscle, leading to even greater rates of muscle [[glycogen]] recovery

## recovery shake
1. recovery shake (macronutrient ratio)^[https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/timing-your-recovery-drink-what-and-when-to-drink/]
	1. 4:1 ([[carbohydrate]]:[[protein]])

## exogenous ketones
1. what were they trying to improve recovery in [[Tour de France]] 2022?
	1. exogenous ketones e.g. team Jumbo-Visma^[https://www.welovecycling.com/wide/2022/07/19/jumbo-visma-nutrition-at-the-tour-ketones/]
		1. some studies say it can be effective^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5670148/]

# biopsychology
1. what facilitates the transition between [[parasympathetic nervous system]] and sympathetic?
	1. (nor)epinephrine^[https://youtu.be/xuBsqTJcRqc?t=2700, Chad Timmerman (TrainerRoad)]

## catecholamines
1. how long does high-intensity endurance exercise increase (nor)epinephrine?
	1. 2 days (and potentially longer due to study limitations)^[https://youtu.be/xuBsqTJcRqc?t=2760, Chad Timmerman (TrainerRoad)]
2. [[hypoglycemia]] → catecholamines
	1. the former can increase the latter[https://youtu.be/xuBsqTJcRqc?t=2860, Chad Timmerman (TrainerRoad)]
		1. [[hypoglycemia]] can e.g. increase [[stress]]
3. hypoxia → catecholamines
	1. the former can increase the latter^[https://youtu.be/xuBsqTJcRqc?t=2850, Chad Timmerman (TrainerRoad)]
4. [[physical exercise]] **characteristics** can elevate (nor)epinephrine levels by 1.5–20x basal rates^[https://youtu.be/xuBsqTJcRqc?t=2910, Chad Timmerman (TrainerRoad)]
