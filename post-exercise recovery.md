1. what causes increased carbohydrate uptake by [[skeletal muscle|muscles]]?^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 264]
	1. during exercise a special population of these proteins moves to the surface of the muscle that is working, and they help bring carbohydrate into the working muscle (they stay on the surface of the muscle for up to four hours following the workout)
	2. insulin â†’ acts on the muscle to recruit a second separate population of these proteins to the surface of the muscle
		1. so, you then have two separate populations of these proteins available to bring carbohydrate into the muscle, leading to even greater rates of muscle [[glycogen]] recovery
