1. associative combinatorial hierarchical learning → [[information#^9344be|knowledge quality]]
	1. the former increases the latter e.g. higher utilization time
		1. i.e. when connecting different concepts → increases utilization time every iteration (not taking into account other factors increasing "value" e.g. network effect)
