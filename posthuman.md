# [[posthuman]] god
1. A variation on the [[posthuman]] theme is the notion of a "[[posthuman]] god"; the idea that posthumans, being no longer confined to the parameters of [[human]] nature, might grow physically and mentally so powerful as to appear possibly god-like by present-day [[human]] standards.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posthuman#cite_note-transhumanistfaq-20] This notion should not be interpreted as being related to the idea portrayed in some science fiction that a sufficiently advanced species may "ascend" to a higher plane of existence—rather, **it merely means that some [[posthuman]] beings may become so exceedingly intelligent and technologically sophisticated that their behaviour would not possibly be comprehensible to modern humans, purely by reason of their limited [[intelligence]] and imagination**.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posthuman#cite_note-27]
