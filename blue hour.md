1. Many artists value this period for the quality of the soft light.
   
   Photographers use blue hour for the tranquil mood it sets. When photographing during blue hour it can be favourable to capture subjects that have artificial light sources, such as buildings, monuments, cityscapes, or bridges.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_hour]
2. The period of [[time]] shortly before the magic hour at sunrise, or after it at sunset, is called the "blue hour". This is when the sun is at a significant depth below the horizon, when residual, indirect sunlight takes on a predominantly blue shade, and there are no sharp shadows because the sun either has not risen, or has already set.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_hour_(photography)]
