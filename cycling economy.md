1. determined by e.g.:^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 13]
	1. physical structure (of your body)
	2. [[bicycle pedal|pedaling efficiency]]
	3. bike handling skills
2. how could cycling economy be calculated?^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 19]
	1. e.g. milliliters of oxygen used per kilometer
		1. analogous to "liters of fuel used per kilometer" for a car
		2. for you as a rider, the less oxygen you use to produce a given power output, the more economical you are
# technique
1. why does Joe Friel refer to "speed skills"?
	1. because you need to master cycling economy at high cadence (which is a lot easier with lower cadences)
	2. It’s easy to master a skill if you do it slowly enough. In fact, that’s the way pedaling skills are typically introduced—at a slow cadence. When the demands of the workout or race require a high cadence, your skills must remain economical. If you become sloppy at high cadences, you’ll waste energy and your fitness will be poor.^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 19]
2. cornering, sprinting, and climbing skills are less complex than pedaling skills^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 19]
# [[physiology]]
1. a cyclist with long thighbones relative to total leg length will likely be more economical than a rider with short thighbones^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 19]
	1. long thighbones provide better leverage in pedaling
2. is the amount of mitochondria you have genetically determined? + why
	1. no, it can be increased via e.g. endurance training ([[mitochondrial biogenesis]])^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_biogenesis]
	2. **The processes of fusion and fission allow for mitochondrial reorganization.**^[By Rtian96 - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=57383373]
