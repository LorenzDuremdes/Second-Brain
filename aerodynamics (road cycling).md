# biomechanics
1. From Voigt’s first attempt to Ganna’s latest, the modern [[hour record]] has been improved by over 11%. Although Ganna is a multiple World [[Time Trial]] champion and likely one of the most suitable riders to attempt the record, the last person to hold the record before him was Daniel Bigham, the only rider on the list that was never a WorldTour rider. Although an accomplished cyclist in his own right, Bigham’s record is a prime example of how far and fast you can get by maximizing the margins, with his record being set at an average power output approximately 100 watts less than Wiggins. Bigham himself puts his performance down to 50% [[physiology]] and 50% equipment (137). One of the main aspects Bigham exploited was aerodynamics; his coefficient of aerodynamic drag (CdA) was ~0.15, which is considerably below what is commonly seen in cyclists, including professionals (41).^[[Can there be two speeds in a clean peloton? Performance strategies in modern road cycling – The Sport Journal](https://thesportjournal.org/article/can-there-be-two-speeds-in-a-clean-peloton-performance-strategies-in-modern-road-cycling/)]

## praying mantis
1. it allows ur shoulders to drop and head to tuck down and in
   
   I believe it was testing from findingfreestyle? Trentnix? Desert dude ? That says parallel bars are actually faster IF all things are the same, eg head position etc etc…..i think the idea with high hands position is to allow that change though. To allow other portions of the body to become more aerodynamic.^[https://forum.slowtwitch.com/forum/Slowtwitch_Forums_C1/Triathlon_Forum_F1/Finish_this_sentence..._Praying_mantis_aerobar_position_is_better_if..._P7818324/?forum_view=forum_view_collapsed&]

   1. In fact, **Campenaerts bends his elbows more than 90°**, which is something rarely seen in cycling. Take a look at the picture above and you can see how Campenaerts puts an enormous amount of pressure on his wrists and shoulders in order to hold this aero position.
      
      Be warned, this kind of extreme aero position takes hundreds of hours to practice and perfect. Of all the [[bike fit]] terms on our list, Campenaerts pushes each of them to the extreme.
      
      His elbows are bent at more than 90°, his hip angle is as small as possible, his back and core is closed in as much as possible, and he tucks and turtles his head until it is almost sniffing his handlebars.
