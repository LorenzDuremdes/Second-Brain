## miscellaneous
1. could aerobars without extensions make you faster + why
	1. The one bottle that we have found to work on everybody is a 28-ounce, normal **water bottle**, and you keep it up high. You don’t put it down in your stomach. You keep it up high on your chest, and that’s when it works.”
	   
	   The pressure coefficient is a dimensionless pressure. In the figures above, red and yellow colors indicate overpressure (so a “push”), and blue indicates suction (so a “pull”). The less the red areas in front of the cyclist, the lower the air resistance. The less the blue areas behind the cyclist, the lower the air resistance.”
	   
	   Blocken found that the type of chest fairing he tested, which is equivalent to sticking a drinking bottle down a tight-fitting, stretchable shirt, can give a drag reduction of more than 9%.^[https://www.triathlete.com/gear/bike/expert-tested-the-water-bottle-jersey-trend-produces-shocking-results/] | see also their pictures of air flow with(out) bottles
2. The **plastic suits** were banned not long after the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]]. They were felt to confer an unfair advantage, and to unacceptably increase costs. The GB team response for the 2012 Olympics was to use the knowledge gained from the plastic suits to develop fabric suits. Plastic was simple – smooth is smooth. Fabric is harder, because the exact texture is critical. This, and the consequent [[drag (physics)|drag]], vary from one fabric to another.^[Faster - The Obsession, Science and Luck Behind the World's Fastest Cyclists (by Michael Hutchinson), p. 130–131]
3. why do you like SPD pedals on a road bike shoe?
	1. because you can use SPD-SL adapters to increase stack height > increase saddle height > go even lower on the bike

# biomechanics
1. From Voigt’s first attempt to Ganna’s latest, the modern [[hour record]] has been improved by over 11%. Although Ganna is a multiple World [[Time Trial]] champion and likely one of the most suitable riders to attempt the record, the last person to hold the record before him was Daniel Bigham, the only rider on the list that was never a WorldTour rider. Although an accomplished cyclist in his own right, Bigham’s record is a prime example of how far and fast you can get by maximizing the margins, with his record being set at an average power output approximately 100 watts less than Wiggins. Bigham himself puts his performance down to 50% [[physiology]] and 50% equipment (137). One of the main aspects Bigham exploited was aerodynamics; his coefficient of aerodynamic drag (CdA) was ~0.15, which is considerably below what is commonly seen in cyclists, including professionals (41).^[[Can there be two speeds in a clean peloton?

## praying mantis
1. it allows ur shoulders to drop and head to tuck down and in
   
   I believe it was testing from findingfreestyle? Trentnix? Desert dude ? That says parallel bars are actually faster IF all things are the same, eg head position etc etc…..i think the idea with high hands position is to allow that change though. To allow other portions of the body to become more aerodynamic.^[https://forum.slowtwitch.com/forum/Slowtwitch_Forums_C1/Triathlon_Forum_F1/Finish_this_sentence..._Praying_mantis_aerobar_position_is_better_if..._P7818324/?forum_view=forum_view_collapsed&]

   1. In fact, **Campenaerts bends his elbows more than 90°**, which is something rarely seen in cycling. Take a look at the picture above and you can see how Campenaerts puts an enormous amount of pressure on his wrists and shoulders in order to hold this aero position.
      
      Be warned, this kind of extreme aero position takes hundreds of hours to practice and perfect. Of all the [[bike fit]] terms on our list, Campenaerts pushes each of them to the extreme.
      
      His elbows are bent at more than 90°, his hip angle is as small as possible, his back and core is closed in as much as possible, and he tucks and turtles his head until it is almost sniffing his handlebars.

1. how can you replicate having aerobars without aerobars (i.e. including its support)?
	1. use the bike computer like Dylan Johnson did at Unbound Gravel 2024^[https://www.instagram.com/p/C7pLaMaOWJK/?img_index=1] ![[Dylan Johnson Unbound Gravel 2024 (Instagram).png]]

# history
1. how did they try to minimize frontal area and aerodynamics before computers?
	1. Once upon a [[time]] the cutting-edge way to optimise rider aerodynamics was by printing out photos of the rider taken head on, cutting them out, and weighing the paper. If you did this for a variety of positions on the bike, you found out which presented the smallest frontal area to the wind by finding the lightest bit of paper.^[Faster - The Obsession, Science and Luck Behind the World's Fastest Cyclists (by Michael Hutchinson), p. 120]
