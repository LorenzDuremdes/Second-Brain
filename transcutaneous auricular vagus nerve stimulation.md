1. Transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS) has been reported to improve the clinical symptoms of [[primary insomnia]]. taVNS enhances [[sleep onset latency]], [[sleep quality]], and [[sleep hygiene|sleep behaviors]], and it also directly attenuates autonomic nerve imbalance, including hypersensitivity to external stimuli and negative mood. taVNS currents trigger [[brain]] regions involved in ascending [[sleep]]-related projections, including the [[locus coeruleus]], [[periaqueductal gray]], [[hypothalamus]], and [[thalamus]]. It promotes the secretion of [[melatonin]] and [[GABA]] to induce a [[sedation|sedative]] effect that facilitates the effortless transition to a [[sleep cycle|sleep state]].^[[[PDF] Autonomic Dysfunction in Sleep Disorders: From Neurobiological Basis to Potential Therapeutic Approaches | Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/reader/f9d6a046ba7f1c5800768b8e4a0453774c18246f)]
