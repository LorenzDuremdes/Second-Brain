1. at what ambient [[temperature]] are chilblains most likely to develop?
	1. The cold weather conditions that can be endured by humans depend on combination of the duration and the extent of the exposure, in addition to physiological adaptive changes. However, susceptibility to chilblains increases **when ambient temperature is less than 10 degrees C** and relative humidity is more than 60%. Elderly, females, outdoor workers and those having chronic or recurrent episodes of chilblains are less tolerant to cold weather and develop the disease under lesser ambient cold.^[[Onset of chilblains in relation with weather conditions](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19385449/)]
