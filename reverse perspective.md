1. reverse perspective; a form of perspective drawing where the objects depicted in a scene are placed between the projective point and the viewing plane. Objects further away from the viewing plane are drawn as larger, and closer objects are drawn as smaller, in contrast to the more conventional linear perspective where closer objects appear larger. Lines that are parallel in three-dimensional space are drawn as diverging against the horizon, rather than converging as they do in linear perspective.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_perspective]
