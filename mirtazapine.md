2. A 2012 review focused on [[antidepressant|antidepressants]] and [[sleep]] found that in many people with [[dyssomnia|sleep disorders]] caused by [[depression]], mirtazapine reduces the [[sleep onset latency|time it takes to fall asleep]] and increases the [[sleep quality|quality of sleep]], but that in some people it can disturb [[sleep]], especially at higher doses, causing restless leg syndrome in 8 to 28% of people and in rare cases causes REM sleep behavior disorder. This seemingly paradoxical dose–response curve of mirtazapine with respect to somnolence is owed to the exceptionally high affinity of the drug for the histamine H1, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C receptors; exhibiting near exclusive occupation of these receptors at doses ≤15 mg. However, at higher doses, inverse agonism and constitutive activation of the α2A-, α2B-, and α2C-adrenergic receptors begins to offset activity at H1 receptors leading to decreased somnolence and even a subjective sensation of "activation" in treated patients.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirtazapine#Depression]
