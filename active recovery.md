## [[physiology]]
1. [[road cycling|cycling]] active recovery (duration)
	1. <90 minutes^[https://fascatcoaching.com/tips/recovery/]
	2. ![image](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5078313ae4b0e7addb844764/1441845381072-E7Y671HVKZX08CWUCW11/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kNptsgP_BQir-T8qosybtkdZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIguU-sV11r-Z6jBGRef1uF5TQf5twfQhLvG2XDpy3Vlg/image-asset.png?format=1000w)^[https://www.mountainpeakfitness.com/blog/power-heart-rate-zones-for-the-endurance-athlete]
	3. why not just do ~3 hours of active recovery to increase [[carbohydrate]] intake?
		1. because there's a [[trade-off]] between it increasing fatigue and recovery benefits of more carbohydrates
			1. e.g. <20% [[task failure]]

## [[biochemistry]]
1. why perhaps not do ~30m active recovery immediately after a workout (rather than hours after e.g. after dinner) with 70 g [[sucrose]]?
	1. the proteins might be more important after workout (30m earlier) e.g. anabolism
	2. preventing [[reactive hypoglycemia]] after dinner (and enabling more [[carbohydrate]] intake (without e.g. [[reactive hypoglycemia]]))
		1. the active recovery sessions are more meant to enable more [[carbohydrate]] intake without reducing anabolism after workout or increase fatigue

## [[sports science (cycling)]]
1. stad ↮ buiten de stad → active recovery/light session ([[road cycling]])
	1. in de stad fietsen kan helpen met active recovery/light session doordat je geforceerde rustmomenten krijgt (e.g. stoplichten) of langzamer moet gaan door anderen
		1. handig als wilskracht een probleem is, persoonlijk
2. can effective recovery rides feel challenging? + why^[https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/recovery-for-cyclists-why-its-important-and-how-to-improve-it/]
	1. yes due to being in a fatigued state
		1. "Though they can feel challenging when you’re in a fatigued state, these workouts aren’t strenuous and should promote recovery."

## biopsychology
1. active recovery → (para)[[sympathetic nervous system]]
	1. the former might increase the switch from sympathetic to parasympathetic^[https://youtu.be/xuBsqTJcRqc?t=3180, Chad Timmerman (TrainerRoad)]
		1. including everything else e.g. cooling down temperature (◇+ melatonin)

# nutrition
1. is "[[nutrient timing]] · composition" important for "active recovery"? + why^[https://youtu.be/tz7vvvnzU4w?t=420, TrainerRoad with Chad Timmerman]
	1. can be, because e.g. insulin sensitivity increases (and e.g. allows for quicker [[glycogen]] replenishment)

# possible mistakes
1. should you skip "active recovery" if noticing that it impaired your recovery/next workout(s)? + what^[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz7vvvnzU4w (13:00), TrainerRoad with Chad Timmerman]
	1. no, then you might simply have to decrease intensity (or you went harder than planned/recommended)
