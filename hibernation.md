1. hibernation â†’ [[sleep deprivation]]
	1. In summary, [[NREM sleep]] in a state of mild body cooling may be the preferred biological condition, but clearly in extreme environments, [[winter]] survival or times of food scarcity the restorative effects of [[sleep]] are, at least in part, sacrificed for [[energy]] conservation. As [[sleep]] can only be maintained at higher temperatures, it is energetically more expensive than [[torpor]] or hibernation. At these colder [[brain]] and [[basal metabolic rate|core temperatures]], [[sleep]] debts accumulate almost three times slower than during waking (Deboer and Tobler, 2003).^[[The Temperature Dependence of Sleep - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/)]
