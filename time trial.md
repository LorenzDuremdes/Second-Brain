1. "It’s not the person who goes the fastest who wins, but the person who slows down the least." —Graeme Obree^[https://www.bikeradar.com/features/why-its-faster-to-ride-hard-into-a-headwind-than-with-a-tailwind/]
	1. In other words, keep your average [[speed]] up throughout, rather than peaking on some sections and stalling on others
2. why is [[time]] trialing also known as "race of truth"?^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 19]
	1. because there's not much you can do tactically to hide your limiter. It's just you and the clock.
		1. unlike e.g. a bad climber (he can simply go to the front and slowly retreat to the back during a climb)

# [[sports science]]
1. should you do TT simulations of the real world early on + what to do perhaps instead if not?
	1. perhaps not because they can be unnecessarily fatiguing e.g. Z7 intervals at the beginning with negative splits (to perhaps supra-FTP at the end), which reduces CTL e.g. perhaps better to train to being able to do as much sweet spot as possible within a [[microcycle]]/[[mesocycle]] i.e. [[block (sports periodization)]]
		1. what are other moments you can (and perhaps should) do them early on?
			1. e.g. at end of a [[microcycle]] (before e.g. weekend)/[[mesocycle]] (before a deload microcyle)
			2. when having skipped 1 or more workouts (and feeling recovered well enough + not hindering further workouts / CTL)

# equipment
1. how could it make sense that aero **overshoes** save so many watts relatively?
	1. ◇quadratic air resistance at top of pedal stroke
		1. same as spokes
2. **disc wheel**, watt savings≈35 watts at 32 km/h compared to a normal wheel^[https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/whats-the-big-deal-with-aerodynamics/]

# technicalities / pacing
1. [power required for a 40 kph TT (anecdotes)](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/power-required-for-a-40kph-tt/64520)

# [[negative split]]
1. what's another advantage of [[negative split]] other than physiologically/psychologically? (triathlon)
	1. [[aerodynamics (road cycling)]] → progressively increasing speed in any race allows the runner to focus on passing each person running directly ahead.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_split#cite_note-19] (cyclist in this case)
