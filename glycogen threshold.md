[[glycogen]] threshold; a critical absolute level of [[glycogen]] depletion must be induced for significant activation of [[cell signaling|cell signalling]] pathways to occur on the proviso, of course, that the desired training workload and intensity can be completed without any maladaptations^[[Fuel for the Work Required: A Theoretical Framework for Carbohydrate Periodization and the Glycogen Threshold Hypothesis | Sports Medicine (springer.com)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-018-0867-7#Sec8)]
2. reduced muscle [[glycogen]] stores induce greater [[skeletal muscle]] [[cell signaling]] when compared with “matched-work” exercise protocols (i.e., completion of identical duration and intensity) undertaken with high [[glycogen]] stores (Bartlett et al. 2015)
   
   For example, AMPK<sup>Thr172M</sup> phosphorylation (Yeo et al. 2010; Lane et al. 2015), ACCSer79 phosphorylation (Bartlett et al. 2013), AMPK-*α*2 activity (Wojtaszewski et al. 2003), and the nuclear abundance of AMPK-*α*2 [[protein]] content (Steinberg et al. 2006) are all up-regulated to a greater extent when acute exercise is completed with reduced pre-exercise muscle [[glycogen]] stores, an effect likely mediated via the presence of a [[glycogen]]-binding domain on the *β*-subunit of the AMPK heterotrimer (McBride et al. 2009). Furthermore, exogenous CHO feeding during exercise attenuates AMPK activity only when muscle [[glycogen]] sparing has occurred (Akerstrom et al. 2006). The present data extend these findings as we show for the first [[time]] comparable [[cell signaling]] effects despite the completion of significantly less work completed. Indeed, although we observed no effects of exercise on AMPK-*α*1 activity (as reported by others, Fuji et al. 2000), we observed similar increases in AMPK-*α*2 activity and PGC-1*α* mRNA expression at comparable levels of absolute [[glycogen]], despite mean differences of 60 min less work completed in LOW + LEU versus HIGH conditions. Such data therefore support the “[[glycogen]] threshold” hypotheses (Philp et al. 2012) surmising that a critical absolute level of [[glycogen]] must be exceeded in order for significant AMPK signaling to occur during prolonged endurance exercise protocols.
   
   intuitively, **train-low sessions may be best left to those training sessions in which the intensity and duration of the session is not likely to be compromised by reduced CHO availability**, for example, steady-state type training sessions performed at intensities below the [[lactate threshold]].
   
   from a practical perspective, our data suggest that while there may be benefits of restricting CHO intake in the post-exercise period in terms of enhancing mitochondrial signaling, it is also **necessary to consume sufficient CHO intake in the immediate post-exercise period** so as to replenish muscle [[glycogen]] to sufficient levels per se and/or obtain upstream signaling effects associated with feeding, the result of which could maintain the activity of those signaling proteins with putative roles in regulating MPS and [[skeletal muscle]] remodeling^[[Fuel for the work required: a practical approach to amalgamating train‐low paradigms for endurance athletes - Impey - 2016 - Physiological Reports - Wiley Online Library](https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.14814/phy2.12803)]
