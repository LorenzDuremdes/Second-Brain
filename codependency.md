# [[psychology]]
1. codependency emanates from low [[self-esteem]] (e.g. [[guilt]], fear, insecurity...) while kidness from [[self-esteem]]^[Codependency For Dummies by Darlene Lancer, p. 50]
2. codependency → [[looking-glass self]]^[Codependency For Dummies by Darlene Lancer, p. 23]
	1. codependents develop a persona in the world that reacts to others, to their own [[self]]-criticism, and to their imagined ideal of who they should be. To be acceptable to others and to themselves, you hide who you are and become who you aren’t

## [[self]]
1. codependents usually don't know well why they are e.g. upset^[Codependency For Dummies by Darlene Lancer, p. 38]

## [[depression]]
1. peaceful relationship → [[depression]] · codependency^[Codependency For Dummies by Darlene Lancer, p. 83]
	1. the underlying [[depression]] can be unmasked as e.g. melodramatic relationships provided distraction

# [[microsociology]]
1. how do codependents usually feel they are being treated as in relationships?^[Codependency For Dummies by Darlene Lancer, p. 23]
	1. ...many codependents tolerate being treated without respect, because they lack [[self]]-worth. They don’t feel entitled to compliments, to be truly loved, or to set limits. They might do more than their share at work or in a relationship to earn acceptance, but they end up [[feeling]] unappreciated, used, or resentful.

		to cope, they sometimes disregard what’s actually happening, ruminate with worry or [[resentment]], or finally explode
2. partner [[feeling]] negative (e.g. [[anger]] or sad) → codependent>usual first thoughts^[Codependency For Dummies by Darlene Lancer, p. 59]
	1. "what did I do wrong?"

		rather than e.g. staying neutral or realizing it might not be because of you (mostly)
## [[personal boundaries]]
1. **example**

	she felt guilty taking time for herself or refusing to discuss her therapy with her husband

	why? e.g.:
	1. her parents violated her boundaries^[Codependency For Dummies by Darlene Lancer, p. 61]
		1. e.g. "taking time for herself" → boundary

## maladaptive [[coping]]
1. recall some 'soft' methods people use to gain control when being afraid of being direct^[Codependency For Dummies by Darlene Lancer, p. 74]:
	1. ✓ Helplessness or passivity  
	2. ✓ Withholding  
	3. ✓ Isolating  
	4. ✓ Talking  
	5. ✓ Silence  
	6. ✓ Gifts and favors  
	7. ✓ [[Seduction]]  
	8. ✓ Pleasing and caretaking

# [[biology]]
1. [[women]] are more likely to develop codependency^[Codependency For Dummies by Darlene Lancer, p. 48]
# examples
1. ‘I’ll change him (or her) to do what I want, and then I’ll be happy.’^[https://www.gottman.com/blog/how-i-stopped-trying-to-control-my-partner-and-took-responsibility-for-my-own-happiness/]
2. Now, instead of playing therapist without their consent, I say, “What you’re describing sounds like something I’ve been reading about lately. Do you want to hear the connection?” or “I found an article that describes the type of family you grew up in. Do you want me to send it to you?”

	At first, their refusal baffled and insulted me. _They have no idea how much this information could_ help _them!_ I’d fume silently. _They must not care about their healing or personal growth. They must not [[trust]] that I know what I’m talking about._^[[https://www.gottman.com/blog/how-i-stopped-trying-to-control-my-partner-and-took-responsibility-for-my-own-happiness/]]
