1. Under this hypothesis, the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neural systems, or the E/I balance, should be tightly maintained within a permissible range for optimal [[brain]] functions. However, in ASD, the E/I imbalance hypothesis presumes this balance is disrupted.
   
   the E/I imbalance hypothesis suggested a bias toward excitation
   
   an excessive amount of excitation or reduction of inhibition, causes too much noise in [[information processing (psychology)|information processing]]. Several lines of evidence support the E/I imbalance hypothesis.
   
   Second, postmortem studies have shown a reduction in the inhibitory system (e.g. reductions in [[γ-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA)<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor density and reductions in the enzyme that converts [[glutamic acid]] to [[GABA]]). Alternatively, an increase in the excitatory system (e.g. increases in the [[messenger RNA|mRNA]] levels of genes including [[excitatory amino acid transporter 1]] and [[glutamate receptor]] of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid ([[AMPA]])) has been shown in brains with ASD.^[[Are sleep disturbances a cause or consequence of autism spectrum disorder? - Yamada - 2023 - Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences - Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pcn.13550)]
2. E/I balance = Glx concentration divided by [[GABA]] concentration^[[Are sleep disturbances a cause or consequence of autism spectrum disorder? - Yamada - 2023 - Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences - Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pcn.13550)]

# [[sleep]]
1. [[sleep]] → E/I balance
	1. A recent animal study showed that the E/I balance of synaptic activity changes across the 24-h day in a [[sleep]]-dependent manner. Inhibitory processing was upregulated during [[sleep]], while excitatory processing was downregulated during [[sleep]]. The result indicates that the E/I balance is not fixed but dynamically changes in a [[sleep]]-dependent manner. A human MRS study showed that [[sleep deprivation]] increased the concentration of Glx in the [[basal ganglia]] compared with that before [[sleep deprivation]], whereas the concentration of [[GABA]] was unchanged.^[[Are sleep disturbances a cause or consequence of autism spectrum disorder? - Yamada - 2023 - Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences - Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pcn.13550)]
2. [[non-rapid eye movement sleep|NREM]] vs. [[REM sleep]] → E/I balance
	1. The researchers found that the [[GABA]] concentration was decreased during [[NREM sleep]] compared to baseline, which was the mean concentration of [[GABA]] during wakefulness. In contrast, the Glx concentration was unchanged during [[NREM sleep]] compared to baseline, which was the mean concentration of Glx during wakefulness. During [[REM sleep]], both [[GABA]] and Glx concentrations were unchanged.
	   
	   When visual training preceded the nap session, the Glx concentration was decreased during [[REM sleep]], while the other patterns of [[GABA]] and Glx changes during [[NREM sleep]] and the [[GABA]] change during [[REM sleep]] were the same as [[sleep]] without prior training.
	   
	   Thus, the E/I ratio changed depending on [[sleep cycle|sleep stages]] and training before the [[polysomnography|sleep session]] (Table 1)^[[Are sleep disturbances a cause or consequence of autism spectrum disorder? - Yamada - 2023 - Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences - Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pcn.13550)]

3. Evidence suggests that Hypothesis 3 is the most likely. A research group performed a longitudinal study of ASD individuals and attempted to categorize ASD by neural, biological, behavioral, and clinical characteristics and developmental trajectories; they reported that some of the subgroups tended to show frequent [[sleep]] problems. Another recent infant study showed that early [[dyssomnia|sleep problems]], including difficulty falling asleep at 6–12 months old, are closely related not only to a subsequent diagnosis with ASD but also to enlargement of the [[hippocampus]], which is a characteristic of a subset of ASD, in children at high risk for ASD. In addition, as we mentioned above, [[sleep]] disturbances are closely associated with core symptoms of ASD.
   
   Schematic illustration of Hypotheses 1, 2, and 3. Hypothesis 1 assumes that ASD subcategorization, the heterogeneity of ASD, has a causal relationship with the E/I imbalance in ASD. [[Sleep]] disturbance is not associated with either ASD subcategorization or the E/I imbalance. Hypothesis 2 assumes that [[sleep]] disturbance is a confounding factor affecting the E/I imbalance. In this case, [[sleep]] disturbance is not related to ASD subcategorization. Thus, after removing the confounding [[sleep]] factor, we may be able to investigate the relationship between ASD subcategorization and E/I imbalance. Hypothesis 3 assumes that [[sleep]] disturbance is part of ASD subcategorization and is causally associated with E/I imbalance. In this case, investigating E/I balance during [[sleep]] could improve our understanding of ASD pathology.
   
   If Hypothesis 3 is correct, this further suggests that ASD (or its heterogeneity) and [[sleep]] abnormality (or its type) share common abnormalities in genes or hormones. For example, 15q11-13 duplication, which involves [[gene]] duplication of the [[GABA receptor]], is known to show high penetrance for ASD and [[sleep]] disturbances in human and animal studies. [[Melatonin]], [[oxytocin]], [[orexin]], and [[serotonin]] are also molecules involved in [[sleep]] abnormalities, ASD pathology, and neuroplasticity.^[[Are sleep disturbances a cause or consequence of autism spectrum disorder? - Yamada - 2023 - Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences - Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pcn.13550)] ![[Schematic illustration of Hypotheses 1, 2, and 3.jpg]]
