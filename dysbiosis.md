1. dysbiosis; characterized by a disruption to the [[microbiome]] resulting in an imbalance in the [[microbiota]], changes in their functional composition and metabolic activities, or a shift in their local distribution.
   
   For example, a part of the [[human microbiota]] such as the [[skin flora]], [[gut microbiota|gut flora]], or vaginal flora, can become deranged (unbalanced), when normally dominating species become underrepresented and species that normally are outcompeted or contained increase to fill the void.
