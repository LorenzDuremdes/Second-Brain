1. Matthew effect; the tendency of individuals to accrue social or economic success in proportion to their initial level of popularity, friends, and wealth
   
   It is sometimes summarized by the adage or platitude "[[the rich get richer and the poor get poorer]]".
   
   The Matthew effect may largely be explained by [[preferential attachment]], whereby wealth or credit is distributed among individuals according to how much they already have.
   
   Also termed the "Matthew effect of accumulated advantage", taking its name from the Parable of the Talents in the biblical Gospel of Matthew, it was coined by sociologists Robert K. Merton and Harriet Zuckerman in 1968.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect]
