1. the center of circadian rhythms regulation can be identified in the [[hypothalamus]]^[[Biological correlates of altered circadian rhythms, autonomic functions and sleep problems in autism spectrum disorder | Annals of General Psychiatry | Full Text (biomedcentral.com)](https://annals-general-psychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12991-022-00390-6#Sec1)]
	1. It consists of several neuronal populations which produce neuropeptides and neurotransmitters with a crucial role for [[temperature]], metabolic rate, thirst, hunger, sexual behavior, reproduction and emotional responses. The [[hypothalamus]] exerts its functions mainly through the productions of neuropeptides.

# [[chronobiology]]
1. [[gut microbiota]] → circadian rhythm (host)
	1. By allowing the bacteria to sense resources coming from the host in order to prepare and metabolize them faster. There are bacteria that have daily timekeepers, and it may be possible that the microbiota have endogenous clocks which communicate with biological clocks of the host. **For instance, if there are some [[time]]-keeping qualities of the microorganisms within the intestines, it might be possible that they can affect the circadian system of the host**. An endogenous clock may be present in some microbial species, and the presence of such an intrinsic timekeeper could be beneficial both in the gut (which experiences daily changes in nutrient availability) and the environment outside of the host (which experiences daily cycles of light and [[temperature]]).^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_advantage#cite_note-:0-6]
	2. [[autism]] · [[gut microbiota]] → circadian rhythm
		- **Metabolic and Neurochemical Communication**: The [[gut-brain axis]] provides a pathway for chemical signaling between the [[gut microbiota]] and the [[brain]]. Disruptions in this communication might influence neurodevelopment and behavior, which are critical in the context of [[autism]].
		- **[[Sleep]] and Behavioral Regulation**: Since individuals with [[autism]] often struggle with [[dyssomnia|sleep issues]], and given that [[sleep]] is regulated by circadian rhythms, a dysregulated microbiota might exacerbate or contribute to [[sleep]] disturbances. Properly timed signals from the microbiota can potentially stabilize these rhythms.
