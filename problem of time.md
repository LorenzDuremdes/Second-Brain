1. problem of [[time]] (theoretical [[physics]]); a conceptual conflict between general relativity and [[quantum mechanics]] in that [[quantum mechanics]] regards the flow of [[time]] as universal and absolute, whereas general relativity regards the flow of [[time]] as malleable and relative.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_time#cite_note-1]

3. Certain quantum gravity treatments, such as the [Wheeler–DeWitt equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeler%E2%80%93DeWitt_equation), imply that [[time]] itself could be an [emergent property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence#Nonliving,_physical_systems).[126] As such, [[physics]] may conclude that [[time]] did not exist before the Big Bang.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang#cite_note-131]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang#cite_note-132]
