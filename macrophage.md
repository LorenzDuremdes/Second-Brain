1. macrophage; a type of [[white blood cell]] of the [[immune system]] that engulfs and digests [[cell|cellular]] debris, foreign substances, microbes, cancer cells, and anything else that does not have the type of proteins specific to healthy body cells on its surface^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage#cite_note-2]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage#cite_note-3] in a process called phagocytosis
2. **Steps of a macrophage ingesting a pathogen**^[By XcepticZP - Own work, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=4203023]:
	a. Ingestion through phagocytosis, a phagosome is formed
	b. The fusion of lysosomes with the phagosome creates a phagolysosome; the pathogen is broken down by enzymes
	c. Waste material is expelled or assimilated (the latter not pictured)
	Parts:
	1. Pathogens
	2. Phagosome
	3. Lysosomes
	4. Waste material
	5. [[Cytoplasm]]
	6. [[Cell membrane]]
