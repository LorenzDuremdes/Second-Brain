# vs. APS-C / M43

The more crisp, colorful and clean comes down to editing, probably. If you are not massively straining your camera, eg above ISO 6400, you are not really in trouble in that respect.

My a7IV is clean enough for me on ISO 12800, so ISO 6400 should be great if you upgrade to an a6700. It has a better sensor than all other a6X00 series, thus it has less noise, better AF than the a7IV and you retaint that compact size.

Biggest disadvantage to full frame for me is, that I can't carry all my lenses with me comfortably. I have to choose what I thake, while with an aps-c kit of similar properties I could just dump them into my bag and not worry, because it's half the size / weight.

The big upside to FF is the one stop advantage in noise performance, the bigger selection of lenses and the power of f1.4 on a full frame body, but it's rarely needed.

Because physics. Smaller APS-C sensor requires very precise glass to resolve a sharp image. Whereas larger FF sensor can get similar results with much cheaper glass. So if you pair high-resolution FF sensor with high end FF glass, you will generally get exceptional sharpness.

I had an A6400 for 3 years & absolutely loved it (still do) before I bought the A7IV. It's not even close when I compare the two images I've captured with them both. The Dynamic range on the A7IV is just outstanding, it's crazy what you can recover from some RAW images. I couldn't imagine going back to APS-C now.

I have two Sony A7IV bodies and last week I bought a Fuji XPro 3, I think I can shed some insight.

I purchased some film simulations for Lightroom, and my Sony both send RAWs via the app to my phone, so I can get that film simulation look with better quality than what Fuji does.

I experienced the same thing years ago when I decided to upgrade from my D7500 to my first Sony, an A7RII. The R2's image quality immediately blew me away. I always laugh any time I see people discouraging full frame. Like, if someone is committed to the hobby and has the money, going full frame can usually only improve their photography. Better IQ, low light performance, etc, makes a difference!

i was in the exact same boat as you. I had the 6500. Finally bit the bullet and upgraded to a7iv. LOVE IT! NEver looked back. The increase in weight is modest but heck I love the images coming out way more. DO IT

My feeling is this. If you want easy to carry and travel, just use a phone. Sometimes you can barely tell the difference between apsc/phone. However there is just something about FF that the colors are richer, resolution more clean etc.

# vs. Medium format

Advocating MF over FF has several problems:
- FF typically has better AF system
- FF typically has larger lens lineup
- FF typically is more affordable
- FF typically has larger aperture lenses available (I mean aperture size vis-a-vis angle of view, not f-number, or normalized to format aperture, or "equivalent f-number")
