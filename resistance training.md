# muscle contraction
1. when matched for total time, high-velocity contractions involve greater peripheral fatigue and less [[central nervous system]] fatigue than low-velocity contractions

## isotonic contraction
1. isotonic contraction; tension in the muscle remains constant despite a change in muscle length.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction#cite_note-Widmaier_et_al_2008-1]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction#cite_note-Aidley_1998-3]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction#cite_note-Sircar_2008-4]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction#cite_note-Bullock_et_al_2001-5]

# concurrent training with [[road cycling]]
1. The weight training exercises to include in your program will largely depend on your current levels of physical function, injury history, technical proficiency, medical history, age, training history, goals, and training phase. Though to get your imagination going, in cycling research, the exercises I primarily see getting used include the following strength, power, and core exercises1,3–5,14,17^[[Weight Training for Cyclists (everything you need to know) - Road Cycling Academy](https://roadcyclingacademy.com/weight-training-for-cyclists/#What_weight_training_exercises_should_I_do_7)]:

3. Calf raises
4. Resisted hip flexion (cable)
5. Trap-bar deadlift
