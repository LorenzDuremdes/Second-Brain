1. Upper Confidence Bound [[algorithm]] · explore/exploit tradeoff · [[prioritization]] · temporal [[continuum]] · [[diminishing returns]] = the potential gains naturally lower when exploiting something (or in some cases actually rise e.g. competence)
2. explore/exploit tradeoff → [[level of measurement]]
	1. probably [[ordinal scale]]
3. the beginning values of the Gittins index tend to (usually) mostly gravitate toward explore (rather than exploit)
	1. e.g. younger people have less data → gravitate more toward the beginning values

# [[optimization]]
1. [[product optimalism|product]] vs. [[process optimalism]] → explore/exploit [[trade-off]]
	1. "[[product optimalism]]" is more related to "exploration"
		1. exploration increases the [[probability]] of "realizing the best possible result"
	2. "[[process optimalism]]" is more related to "exploitation"
		1. exploitation increases the chances of "achieving the best possible result"
