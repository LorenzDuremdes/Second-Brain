1. [Who is this Lidl rider? He is always leading the peloton on every stage.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tourdefrance/comments/1dv9g83/who_is_this_lidl_rider_he_is_always_leading_the/)
	1. Tim the Tractor!
	   
	   He can't go faster and he can't go slower. They just wind him up and set him loose.
	   
	   Tim Declercq specializes in very very long consistent work, sometimes literally hours at the same speed. His job is typically to ride at the front of the peloton on days when Trek wants to keep the breakaway close.
	   
	   He rarely features in the finales. He is usually done and coasting in by then.
	2. He's said himself that he's not a very explosive rider, but one of the all-time great diesel engines of the peloton.
	   
	   If you were designing a race that would guarantee a Tim Declercq win, it would be a 200km time trial.
	3. Wow I had no idea! Bro just pulls the whole time and breaks the wind for everyone else to take all the glory? What an absolute gentleman and a scholar.
	4. He started his career with quick step. There's a story that he called up Lefevre and said "I can't win races and I don't want to, but I'll ride all day on the front because I like doing that". Lefevre made him prove his abilities, then signed him on the spot once he did.
	5. He rode for many years at Quickstep, helping the "wolfpack" clean up all the classic races. I believe he was even voted the best domestique in the peloton for 3-4 years running. That man will happily eat wind all day every day, for 3 weeks flat.
	   
	   Sir Tim Declercq
	6. Bro doesn't care about points or stage wins. Bro just wants to wake up, ride bike, go sleep, repeat.
	7. The tractor! Dude is super humble and will lead any peleton without question for his riders from the minute it starts to 2km before the finish and be super thrilled that his people did well. One of the best!
	8. It doesn’t matter which team he’s on really does it? Every team should contribute to his salary.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/peloton/comments/16mjgz9/comment/k194qp4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]
