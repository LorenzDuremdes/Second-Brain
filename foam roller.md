1. foam rolling > stretching (performance enhancement)
	1. The subgroup analysis revealed that, if the goal is to increase performance, the combination of foam rolling followed by stretching (but not vice versa) should be favored compared to stretching alone.
	   
	   While a single static stretching exercise with a duration of ≥60 s likely causes a pronounced impairment in performance (-4.6%), shorter stretching durations (<60 s) show only minor changes (-1.1%) (Behm et al., 2016). However, if dynamic stretching is applied, Behm et al. (2016) reported mean increases in performance of 1.3%. Thus, performance changes following stretching depend on the stretch duration and stretching technique (Behm et al., 2016; Behm and Chaouachi, 2011; Behm et al., 2021a; Kay and Blazevich, 2012), and are also likely dependent on the muscles stretched (Konrad et al., 2021 . For foam rolling, there seems to be, at least, no detrimental effect on performance (Wiewelhove et al., 2019; Cheatham et al., 2015). Wiewelhove et al. (2019) even reported in their meta-analysis a tendency of improvement in sprint performance but no change in muscle strength. Thus, a single foam rolling exercise might be a practical approach for acutely increasing ROM while expecting an increased or at least stable athletic performance.
	   
	   According to the results of our meta-analysis, it can be recommended that foam rolling (with a duration range between 30 s and 120 s; mean 66.0 ± 36.9 s) or stretching (with a duration range between 10 s and 90 s; mean 65.7 ± 28.8 s) could be performed to increase the ROM of a [[joint]] acutely, rather than a more time-consuming combined treatment.^[[The Accumulated Effects of Foam Rolling Combined with Stretching on Range of Motion and Physical Performance: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8256518/)]
2. does foam rolling increase ROM long-term?
	1. There was a 4.0% acute increase in ROM at week 6 (P = 0.004) for all three groups. ROM increased 8.4% from week 3 to week 7 for all three groups (P < 0.001). When comparing week 1 baseline to week 7, ROM increased 18.3% for all three groups (P = 0.003).
	   
	   **How:** After 30 s of FR, the participant switched leg positions and foam rolled the dominant lower leg. A total of three sets of 30 s of FR was performed on both legs.**
	   
	   In the current investigation, there was no acute change in dorsiflexion ROM due to FR on the first day of training. Škarabot et al. (33) also evaluated the acute effect of SS, FR, and FR + SS using the same dosage of FR (three sets of 30 s) as the current investigation. Although they did not control the speed of FR, their FR alone results were similar to ours in that there was a nonsignificant 2.8% acute increase in dorsiflexion ROM. However, the acute response during the last training session for the current study demonstrated a 3.2% increase in dorsiflexion ROM for the FR group. Our results are also similar to Halperin et al. (29), who documented a 3.6% increase in dorsiflexion ROM 1 min after subjects completed three sets of 30 s of roller massage at a rate of one roll in 1 s, which is the same as our FR protocol. Although no study to date has compared them directly, this suggests that FR and roller massage produce similar results. Aune et al. (32) demonstrated a 9% increase in dorsiflexion ROM 30 min after participants completed three sets of 60 s of FR. **This suggests that a dose–response relationship exists between FR and the magnitude of the acute increase in ROM**.^[[Effects of Static Stretching and Foam Rolling on Ankle Dorsi... : Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise (lww.com)](https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/fulltext/2019/08000/effects_of_static_stretching_and_foam_rolling_on.23.aspx)]

4. An 8-week training with the foam roll is effective in increasing ROM in the stand and reach test without concomitant decreases in core "strength endurance", muscle performance and balance parameters.^[[The Training Effects of Foam Rolling on Core Strength Endurance, Balance, Muscle Performance and Range of Motion: A Randomized Controlled Trial - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31191092/)]
