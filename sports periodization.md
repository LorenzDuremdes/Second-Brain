1. when was sports periodization invented?^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 9]
	1. 1950s (Eastern Bloc countries)
	2. became more common to the West in early 1980s

# training volume landmarks
2. training experience → MAV→MRV
	1. the MAV→MRV gap becomes less with more training experience (e.g. advanced)^[https://youtu.be/YTOfkJ2WsPk?t=540]
		1. e.g. making it less forgivable/difficult to stop at MAV

## [[mesocycle]]
1. what could be the issue of ending a [[mesocycle]] earlier than MRV to make a deload shorter?^[How Much Should I Train by Dr. Mike Israetel and Dr. James Hoffmann, p. 40]
	1. practical issues (e.g deloads are usually a week long) + might also make you prevent PRs  e.g. due to improvement of technique
2. starting a bit higher than MEV → deload
	1. the deload probably doesn't reduce in length due to the beginning near MEV not being much fatiguing^[How Much Should I Train by Dr. Mike Israetel and Dr. James Hoffmann), p. 43]
3. 1. how much gains do you lose (high [[opportunity cost]]) when not going all the way to [[maximum recoverable volume|MRV]] every [[mesocycle]]?
	1. not much (relative)^[https://youtu.be/YTOfkJ2WsPk?t=120]
	2. Dr. Mike Israetel tends to stop just before MRV
	3. more important to go (beyond) MRV for more advanced athletes
4. example when MRV at the end is lower than MEV in the beginning
	1. intensity training^[How Much Should I Train by Dr. Mike Israetel and Dr. James Hoffmann), p. 46]
		1. e.g. having to drop volume to continue to increase intensity (and intensity lowering the MRV)

# [[bulking (diet)]] vs. cutting
1. should I cut or mass?
