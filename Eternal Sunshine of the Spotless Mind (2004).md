1. I saw this in theaters after a bad breakup with a long term girlfriend. I thought I wasted years of my life in that relationship and never wanted to think about her. I was completely taken by surprise by how I interpreted the ending, which was “it doesn’t matter how a relationship ends, the good times were real and worth remembering and appreciating” and it literally changed the way I looked at that relationship and every relationship since. It’s the rare movie that literally changed my life. I think about that final word, “okay”, and what it implies, all the time. Very important film to me.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/195s51j/eternal_sunshine_of_the_spotless_mind/]
