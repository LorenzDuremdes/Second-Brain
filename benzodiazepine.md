   There were studies showing an association, but that doesn’t prove causality, and more recent studies have cast doubt. In a prospective follow-up [study](https://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i90) with 3434 patients, the risk of [[dementia]] actually went down as the dose exposure went up (Gray SL et al, _BMJ_ 2016;352:i90). Another [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31653534/) with 616,256 patients found the same risk of [[dementia]] in people taking benzodiazepines as in those on antidepressants, suggesting that these meds are just a marker for another variable, like having a psychiatric disorder (Baek YH et al, _J Am Med Dir Assoc_ 2020;21(2):201–211.e2). In the early phases, [[dementia]] can present with [[anxiety]] and [[depression]], and that can confound the association. Recently a Danish group tried to get around that by removing patients from their study who developed [[dementia]] within the first two years of starting the benzo, as those were more likely to be cases where early signs of [[dementia]] were misdiagnosed as [[anxiety]] or [[depression]]. They found no association between benzos and [[dementia]] (n = 235,465; Osler M and Jørgensen MB, _Am J [[Psychiatry]]_ 2020;177(6):497–505).
