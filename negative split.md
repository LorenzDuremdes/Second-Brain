1. Moreover, having a negative split strategy means you do not need to worry about having an intense start because you will roll out and be 20-30 W below the threshold.
2. Even if it is at the "sweet spot area", it is manageable, and you can roll and build the effort.
3. The body responds to how it perceives it to be and not how it is. If you feel cooler, you will behave accordingly.
4. The negative split might be hard psychologically because you will have to ride harder at some point, but you can push into it and find that limit.
5. Instead of thinking of sustaining 55.5 km/h, you will go out easier and push until you find the limit yourself.
6. The [[time trial|time trialists]] that understand their bodies can find and sit on that limit.
7. Initially, your sensations do not align with your actual physiological state.
8. Therefore, you will be safe because you will not push more than you need to.
9. It will not impact your distance significantly. People say there is non-linearity with aerodynamic drag, so riding slower and faster will cost you more. However, the differences are minimal when you run the numbers.
10. For example, in my case, it cost me 12 meters. (0.2 W in terms of power production)
11. By doing that, I keep my body core temperature lower and improve my line and position.

1. Another issue, especially in longer races, is a phenomenon called [[cardiovascular drift|cardiac drift]]. As [[dehydration]] creeps in and fatigue builds the [[heart rate|heart beats]] faster to do the same work, and you might find yourself going very slowly to stay on target.
2. Two: Aren’t we supposed to pass people in a race? Certainly, riding at 14 miles per hour is going to result in a lot of people passing you. Those counterintuitive, ego-driven perspectives have to be controlled, and **one must trust the delayed gratification of re-passing those athletes who blew by you at the start of the bike**.
