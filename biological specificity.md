1. biological specificity; the tendency of a characteristic such as a behavior or a biochemical variation to occur in a particular species
2. Biochemist Linus Pauling stated that "Biological specificity is the set of characteristics of living organisms or constituents of living organisms of being special or doing something special. Each animal or [[plant]] species is special. It differs in some way from all other species ... biological specificity is the major problem about understanding life."^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_specificity#cite_note-Pauling-1]
