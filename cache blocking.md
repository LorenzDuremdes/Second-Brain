1. [[cache]] blocking; involves transforming the [[memory]] domain of a given problem into smaller chunks that can fit all the data required for a computation into the [[cache]], maximizing data reuse and reducing the need to access lower [[cache]] hierarchies^[https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/cache-blocking-techniques.html]^[https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/how-to-use-loop-blocking-to-optimize-memory-use-on-32-bit-intel-architecture.html]

# application
1. [[cache]] blocking → [[recursion (computer science)]]
   if a recursive [[algorithm]] operates on large matrices or arrays, restructuring the [[algorithm]] to use [[cache]] blocking may help reduce [[cache]] misses and improve overall performance^[GPT-4]
