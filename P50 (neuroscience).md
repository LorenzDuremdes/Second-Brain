1. P50 (neuroscience); an [[event-related potential]] used to measure [[sensory gating]], or the reduced neurophysiological response to redundant stimuli^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P50_(neuroscience)]
2. how could it make sense that "P50 (neuroscience)" is related to "[[sensory gating]]"?
	1. it has a very low peak latency (ms), which is probably beneficial to happen before any other process
