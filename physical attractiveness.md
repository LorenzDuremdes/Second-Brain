## hair
1. very light, light, medium, and heavy facial hair ([[men]]) → physical attractiveness
	1. light facial hair was rated as the most attractive, followed by medium, heavy, and the least attractive was ‘very light’
	2. This study suggests that some facial hair is better than none because it shows the masculine development as beard growth requires the conversion of [[testosterone]].

A different study found [[women]] are more attracted to clean-shaven faces than bearded faces.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_attractiveness#cite_note-152]
