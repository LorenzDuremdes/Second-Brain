The problem with this study is it only looked at the facial hair of European [[men]] with brown hair. So, the results may not represent [[men]] of all ethnicities and hair colours. A different study found [[women]] are more attracted to clean-shaven faces than bearded faces.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_attractiveness#cite_note-152]
