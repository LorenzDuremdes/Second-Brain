1. Preemptive Modified Highest Response Ratio Next; might combine elements of other scheduling algorithms or methods. For instance, it might integrate aspects of Shortest Job First (SJF) with HRRN to achieve a balance between minimizing waiting times and ensuring fairness + a running process can be forcibly taken off the CPU to allow a higher-priority process to execute^[GPT-3.5]
