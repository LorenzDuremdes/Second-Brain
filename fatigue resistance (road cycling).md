1. fatigue resistance ([[road cycling]]); the ability to keep producing high power outputs after several hours of riding^[https://www.highnorth.co.uk/articles/fatigue-resistance-durability-cycling]
2. I can recount numerous instances of this same type of fatigue resistance with young riders trying to live the dream of going pro. Many of them can hit 5.6 or more watts/kg for 20 minutes, but few—very few—can do that after 2,000-3,000 kJs, and their degradation rates are similar to Joe Rider’s. Fatigue resistance is the elite pro difference.^[https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/the-role-of-fatigue-resistance-at-the-tour-de-france/]
3. reasons why you personally want to increase fatigue resistance:
	1. something besides just merely e.g. FTP (which has a genetic limit as well)
	2. allows you to recover faster and/or train more (e.g. more higher intensity → higher CTL)
3. at what intensity do you personally like to test fatigue resistance + why
	1. lower Z5 (~105%), because you want to estimate whether you can still reliably tap into your dFRC at the end of a [[time trial]] (e.g. headwind/hill/start-stop/corner somewhere at the end)
