# transhuman
1. transhuman → "[[good]] ↮ [[evil]]"
	1. they are not driven by "[[good]] ↮ [[evil]]" but by necessity
	2. **analogy**
		Celestials are similar to any conceptual being in Marvel (Living Tribunal, Order/Chaos, In-Betweener, Eternity, Infinity, Galactus, etc) in that they are beyond mortal concepts of “[[good]]” or “[[evil]]”. They are driven by necessity, rather than morals: they have a task to do, and nothing can be allowed to stand in their way. If that involves eradicating a world and multiple species along with it, so be it.
		
		Humans dont concern themselves with the bacteria they kill by simply changing their diet, and Celestials dont concern themselves with beings that are, to them, akin to bacteria… other than for purposes of experimentation, or finding ways to minimize the damage that bacteria cause.
		
		I explained it like this: the last time you did your laundry you committed genocide. You annihilated billions of lives who were merrily going about their business in your underwear, growing their “[[society]]”… and you just murdered them all using a Tide Pod. You heartless bastard!
		
		It’s the same thing, really.
