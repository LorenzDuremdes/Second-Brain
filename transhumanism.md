# [[human]] enhancement
## physical
1. [[Human]] immortality could be achieved within the next century. How? By continuously replacing every single one of our body parts.^[https://imgur.com/gallery/Qh1eK]

2. it's easier for most people to spend e.g. $12k on a watch than get into top 1% fitness levels^[https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/r0e88f/comment/hlt1gzb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]

## miscellaneous
1. I'd even say many of the more [[health]] conscious people these days would be seen as top-tier bodies compared to people from a few hundred years ago.
   
   Taller, stronger, healthier, and if we go back a few thousand years, some of the fitness freaks today might even pass as a perfect bodied lesser deity.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/1d3h3iy/comment/l69llak/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]

# transhuman
1. transhuman → "[[good]] ↮ [[evil]]"
	1. they are not driven by "[[good]] ↮ [[evil]]" but by necessity
	2. **analogy**
		Celestials are similar to any conceptual being in Marvel (Living Tribunal, Order/Chaos, In-Betweener, Eternity, Infinity, Galactus, etc) in that they are beyond mortal concepts of “[[good]]” or “[[evil]]”. They are driven by necessity, rather than morals: they have a task to do, and nothing can be allowed to stand in their way. If that involves eradicating a world and multiple species along with it, so be it.
		
		Humans dont concern themselves with the bacteria they kill by simply changing their diet, and Celestials dont concern themselves with beings that are, to them, akin to bacteria… other than for purposes of experimentation, or finding ways to minimize the damage that bacteria cause.
		
		I explained it like this: the last time you did your laundry you committed genocide. You annihilated billions of lives who were merrily going about their business in your underwear, growing their “[[society]]”… and you just murdered them all using a Tide Pod. You heartless bastard!
		
		It’s the same thing, really.
