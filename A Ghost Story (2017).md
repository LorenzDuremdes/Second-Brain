   A lot of people are harping on the monologue at the party scene as being needlessly didactic, pretentious, insulting to the audience, etc. But I think that the entire message of the movie is to provide an antithesis to that nihilistic viewpoint. The hippie argues the temporality of everything negates the meaning that people find in art and love. **But Affleck's character literally experiences presumably centuries of aimless watching and waiting, and what is it that he is still ultimately looking for? The one piece of his relationship that he didn't yet get to see. I like to think that the note was an affirmation that Affleck _did_ have a lasting impact on Rooney, as she clearly did on him, unlike what the hippie was trying to say.** Maybe the note was a lyric from his song, or something as simple as "I'll always remember". Whatever it was, I think it was this solace that they'd truly left a profound and lasting impact on _each other_ that finally lets his ghost move on. So, in short, I think the hippie was supposed to come off as pretentious and naive, not as some contrived summarizer of the movie's message. This is supported by the fact that the script includes him bungling some words and missing some facts.
   
   _Probably makes sense as he was probably waiting for her to return to have this affirmation (but the note instead gave this affirmation eventually)_

   Fun fact: that note she wrote and hid in the wall was lost when they destroyed the house, and no one knows what she wrote.
   - I had also heard about the note, and when asked what she wrote she said she couldn't remember.
