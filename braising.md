1. braising; a combination-[[cooking]] method that uses both wet and dry heats: typically, the [[food]] is first [[browning (cooking|browned]] at a high [[temperature]], then [[simmering|simmered]] in a covered pot in cooking liquid (such as wine, [[broth]], coconut milk or beer)
   
   The food to be braised (meats, vegetables, mushrooms, etc.) is first pan-seared to brown its surface and enhance its flavor (through the [[Maillard reaction]])
   
   The dish is then covered and cooked at a very low simmer until the meat becomes so tender that it can be "cut" with just the gentlest of pressure from a fork (versus a knife).^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braising]
