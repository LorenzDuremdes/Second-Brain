	1. In general, such differences as exist indicate that [[women]] tend to employ [[emotion]]-focused coping and the "tend-and-befriend" response to [[stress]], whereas men tend to use problem-focused coping and the "fight-or-flight" response, perhaps because societal standards encourage men to be more individualistic, while [[women]] are often expected to be interpersonal. An alternative explanation for the aforementioned differences involves genetic factors. The degree to which genetic factors and social conditioning influence behavior, is the subject of ongoing debate.

	1. [[Cortisol]], a [[stress]] hormone, was found to be elevated in males during stressful situations. In females, however, [[cortisol]] levels were decreased in stressful situations, and instead, an increase in limbic activity was discovered. Many researchers believe that these results underlie the reasons why men administer a fight-or-flight reaction to [[stress]]; whereas, females have a tend-and-befriend reaction.
