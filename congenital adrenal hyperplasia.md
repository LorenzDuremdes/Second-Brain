1. congenital adrenal hyperplasia; a group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by impaired [[cortisol]] synthesis.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_adrenal_hyperplasia]
2. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to [[21-hydroxylase]] deficiency in all its forms accounts for over 95% of diagnosed cases of all types of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Unless another specific [[enzyme]] is mentioned, CAH in most contexts refers to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, and different mutations related to enzyme impairment have been mapped on [[protein]] structures of the enzyme.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_adrenal_hyperplasia_due_to_21-hydroxylase_deficiency]
3. congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency → testosterone
	1. the high levels of testosterone in the blood can enlarge the phallus, partially or completely close the vaginal opening, enclose the urethral groove so that it opens at the base of the phallus, on the shaft or even at the tip like a boy. Testosterone can cause the labial skin to become as thin and rugate as a scrotum, but cannot produce palpable gonads (i.e., testes) in the folds.
	   
	   Evaluation reveals the presence of a uterus, extreme elevation of 17OHP, levels of testosterone approaching or exceeding the male range
	   
	   A diagnosis of nonclassical CAH is usually confirmed by discovering extreme elevations of 17OHP along with moderately high testosterone levels^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_adrenal_hyperplasia_due_to_21-hydroxylase_deficiency]
	2. Jeff Brown, a Houston endocrinologist who works with some of the best athletes in America—his patients have fifteen Olympic gold medals, collectively—has treated numerous female Olympians with a condition called partial 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which can run in families and causes overproduction of testosterone
	   
	   Brown has seen partial 21-hydroxylase deficiency in men as well, but the effects are less dramatic. Overall, Brown says that the endocrine systems of elite athletes differ noticeably from those of most adults. “There are all sorts of things peculiar to athletes,” he says. “They are not made like me in terms of their hormonal milieu.”^[The Sports Gene: Inside the Science of Extraordinary Athletic Performance, p. 74¸ 332]
