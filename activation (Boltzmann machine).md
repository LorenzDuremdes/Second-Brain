1. activation (Boltzmann machine); in a Boltzmann machine, the activation is interpreted as the [[probability]] of generating an action potential spike, and is determined via a logistic function on the sum of the inputs to a unit
	1. unit; node
	2. why "Boltzmann"? â†’ only dependent on last input ([[Markov property]])?
