1. osmotic concentration; the measure of solute concentration defined as the number of osmoles (Osm) of solute per litre (L) of solution (osmol/L or Osm/L)^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotic_concentration]
2. formerly known as osmolarity^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotic_concentration#cite_note-1]
3. osmotic concentration vs. molar concentration
	1. molarity measures the number of moles of solute per unit volume of solution, osmolarity measures the number of *osmoles of solute particles* per unit volume of solution.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotic_concentration#cite_note-Widmaier-2]

# applicabilities
1. this value allows the [[measurement]] of the osmotic pressure of a solution and the determination of how the solvent will diffuse across a semipermeable [[membrane]] (osmosis) separating two solutions of different osmotic concentration.

# calculation
1. Ionic compounds, such as salts, can dissociate in solution into their constituent ions, so there is not a one-to-one relationship between the molarity and the osmolarity of a solution. For example, sodium chloride (NaCl) dissociates into Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>âˆ’</sup> ions. Thus, for every 1 mole of NaCl in solution, there are 2 osmoles of solute particles (i.e., a 1 mol/L NaCl solution is a 2 osmol/L NaCl solution). Both sodium and chloride ions affect the osmotic pressure of the solution.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotic_concentration#cite_note-Widmaier-2]
