1. weed; a [[plant]] considered undesirable in a particular situation, growing where it conflicts with [[human]] preferences, needs, or goals.
   
   taxonomically, the term "weed" has no botanical significance, because a plant that is a weed in one context, is not a weed when growing in a situation where it is wanted.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weed]
