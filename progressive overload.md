# [[sports periodization]]
1. same workload · same fatigue over several days/weeks ↮ same workload · raising fatigue → fitness (e.g. [[road cycling]])
	1. the former might only increase fitness the first couple days
	2. the latter is more like drop sets
	3. things like under-recovering via a caloric deficit probably don't work → [[goal]] is highest fitness
	4. **see also**
		1. there was some tentative evidence the Z2 work in this situation had some similar impacts to e.g. the final hour of a 3 or 4 hour workout^[https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/who-has-incorporated-two-a-days-into-their-training/60321/3?u=lorenz_duremdes]

## [[endurance training]]
1. what are the positives and negatives of the following vs. doing it vice versa? ![[Sweet Spot Progression (WindWarrior, TrainerRoad).png]]
	1. this way:
		1. you somewhat know more easily (e.g. 'only' doing it for 30m) what pace you can hold for a bit longer than 20m (which is based on FTP)
			1. you can more easily increase duration afterward (and don't have to guess when upping the intensity rather than duration e.g. not going above FTP)
	2. vice versa:
		1. might be better if wanting to drive CTL up (e.g. less fatiguing) and doing more in the 'second phase' (increasing intensity)
			1. possibly more adaptations (if guessing the intensities correctly thereafter)

# overload
1. "[[maximum recoverable volume]]" is related to "product optimalism"

  
	"overload ([[sports science]])" is related to "process optimalism"
	
	1. the latter is a % of the former
