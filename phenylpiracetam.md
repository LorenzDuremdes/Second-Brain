1. Phenotropil® instructions^[https://extrapharmacy.ru/pdf/Phenotropil.pdf]
	1. the **average single dose** is from 100 to 250 mg; average daily dose of 200 to 300 mg. The maximum permissible dose - 750 mg / day. It is recommended to take daily dose of 100 mg - once in the morning, and more than 100 mg - divided into 2 doses.
	2. duration of treatment** may vary from 2 weeks to 3 months, on average - 30 days. If necessary, the course may be repeated after 1 month
		1. to improve performance - 100-200 mg once daily in the morning for 2 weeks (for **athletes** - 3 days)
			1. In healthy people, Phenotropil is used to increase mental and physical as well as the body's resistance to extreme influences. For example, in a group of practically healthy men who received Phenotropil at a dose of 100 mg, 200 mg or placebo once before the start of the usual training sessions, an assessment of mental (using four computerized tests) and physical performance (by means of bicycle ergometry - PWC-170 test) was carried out. According to the results, in the Phenotropil group, in comparison with the background, an increase in the average group values of mental (for example, concentration and stability of attention, short-term memory) and physical performance (both absolute and relative) after an intensive training load was revealed. **The severity of the effect on the dynamics of psychological and physiological parameters in practically healthy individuals was higher when taking 100 mg of Phenotropil per day than 200 mg per day**^[Malyugin V.N., Cherepanov E.G., Akhapkina V.I.

			2. among athletes with high physical and psycho-emotional loads, a comparative placebo-controlled study of Phenotropil and mesocarb showed that the use of Phenotropil for three days maintained a high level of performance and consolidated the achieved results, significantly **improved the quality of sleep with a reduction in its duration and significantly increased the reserves of the adrenal cortex, which indicates the stress-protective effect of the drug**.^[Portugalov S.N., Akhapkina V.I.

	4. ![[pharmacokinetic data (phenylpiracetam), Wikipedia.png|200]]
2. developed in 1983 as a [[medication]] for **Soviet Cosmonauts to treat the prolonged stresses of working in space**. Phenylpiracetam was created at the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Biomedical Problems in an effort led by psychopharmacologist Valentina Ivanovna Akhapkina (Валентина Ивановна Ахапкина).^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylpiracetam#cite_note-mediru-2]
	2. Clinical trials were conducted at the Serbsky State Scientific Center for Social and Forensic [[Psychiatry]]. The Serbsky Center, Moscow Institute of [[Psychiatry]], and Russian Center of Vegetative Pathology are reported to have confirmed the effectiveness of Phenylpiracetam(Phenytropil) describing the following effects: improvement of regional [[blood]] flow in ischemic regions of the [[brain]], reduction of depressive and [[anxiety]] disorders, increase the resistance of [[brain]] tissue to hypoxia and toxic effects, improving concentration and mental activity, a psychoactivating(sic) effect, increase in the threshold of pain sensitivity, improvement in the quality of [[sleep]], and an [[anticonvulsant]] action, though with the [[side effect]] of an anorexic effect in extended use.
3. many people report that phenylpiracetam effects (especially **stimulation**) are more pronounced than other racetams. That may be due phenypiracetam's action as a [[dopamine]] reuptake inhibitor and [[norepinephrine|noradrenaline]] reuptake inhibitor.^[https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenylpiracetam#cite_note-6]^[https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenylpiracetam#cite_note-Firstova2011-5]
4. phenylpiracetam has been shown to possess a [[stimulant]] action in animal models and thus appears on the list of stimulants banned for in-competition use by the **World Anti-[[Doping]] Agency**. This list is applicable in all Olympic sports.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylpiracetam#cite_note-16]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylpiracetam#cite_note-EP20140000021-11]
5. phenylpiracetam is thought to increase acetylcholine release within **hippocampal** cells.^[https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenylpiracetam#cite_note-Savchenko2005-8] As acetylcholine is involved in the function of [[memory]], this could potentially account for its reported nootropic effects.
6. the chronic use of phenylpiracetam can be considered as non-addictive with a low potential for abuse. It does not seem to be capable of causing psychological dependence among users, although this fact has not been corroborated by clinical studies. **[[drug tolerance|Tolerance]]** to many of the effects of phenylpiracetam develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Phenylpiracetam may presents [[cross-tolerance]] with all racetam nootropics, meaning that after the consumption of phenylpiracetam certain nootropics such as aniracetam and piracetam may have a reduced effect.
