1. monosodium glutamate; used in [[cooking]] as a [[flavor]] enhancer with a savory taste that intensifies the [[umami]] flavor of [[food]], as naturally occurring glutamate does in foods such as stews and [[meat]] soups. Found naturally in some foods including [[tomato|tomatoes]] and [[cheese]] in this [[glutamic acid]] form.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monosodium_glutamate]
2. is monosodium glutamate on its own good tasting?
	1. we like savoury but only in the context of salt or sugar – MSG on its own is not pleasant^[Ultra-Processed People The Science Behind the Food That Isnt Food (Chris van Tulleken), p. 175]
3. MSG makes crappy food taste OK and good food taste even better.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/189ey5w/is_msg_really_that_much_of_a_game_changer_any/]

	1. My salt shaker is 1/3 MSG, 2/3 salt and I’ve got nothing but compliments on my food. Don’t tell my wife.
	2. For years I made home made salsa, it was good but there was always something missing. 2 years ago I started putting msg in it and it's a whole other level of amazing.

	1. I’ve won multiple chili cook-offs, and one of my main secrets is MSG.
		1. I put that shit in everything.
		2. maybe a 1/4 tsp to start? I don't love a heavy application, it starts to have a weird mouthfeel with too much. But YMMV
			1. Are the folks who say to ½ & ½ it are using regular table salt? Or maybe Morton’s kosher? Because with Diamond Crystal, that would be waaaaaaaaaay over the top for me msg-wise.
	2. I use a 1:2 ratio of MSG and salt on everything I eat lol
