1. parabrachial nuclei ([[neuroscience]])^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabrachial_nuclei#Function]:
	1. a population of [[neuron|neurons]] in the external lateral parabrachial subnucleus that contain the [[neurotransmitter]] calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) appears to be critical for relaying [[information]] about **[[hypoxia]] (low blood oxygen) and/or [[hypercapnia]] (high blood CO2) to forebrain sites to “wake up the [[brain]]” (arouse)** when breathing is inadequate to meet physiological demands during [[sleep]]. This resulting “wakefulness drive to breath” contributes to prevention of [[asphyxia]].
	2. Other neurons in the superior lateral parabrachial nucleus that contain cholecystokinin have been found to **prevent [[hypoglycemia]]**.
	3. Other neurons in the dorsal lateral parabrachial nucleus that contain dynorphin [[thermoreceptor|sense skin temperature]] from spinal afferents, and send that [[information]] to neurons in the [[preoptic area]] involved in [[thermoregulation]]. A study in 2017, has shown this [[information]] to be relayed through the lateral parabrachial nucleus rather than the [[thalamus]], which drives thermoregulatory behaviour.
	4. Parabrachial neurons in rodents that **relay taste information** to the ventroposterior parvocellular (taste) nucleus of the [[thalamus]] are mainly CGRP neurons in the external medial parabrachial nucleus and they project predominantly contralaterally, as well as a smaller number in the ventral lateral nucleus, which project mainly ipsilaterally.
	5. The parabrachial nucleus **relays satiety and pain-related signals to higher brain regions**; when inhibited, this can produce "liking" responses to certain pleasurable stimuli, such as sweet taste.
