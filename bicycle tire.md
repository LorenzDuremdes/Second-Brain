1. **casing losses**; the amount of [[energy]] that you are losing when your tire is deflected and loses [[heat]]
   
   **impedance losses**; the amount the system is moved up or down based on a bump.  For example, on a perfectly rigid wheel like something found on an in-line skate or skateboard if you hit a 5 mm bump, the entire system is lifted 5 mm off the ground.
   
   **breakpoint pressure**; where casing losses are no longer the leading contributor, but surface impedance becomes the driving force to slow you down
   
   The rougher the surface, the smaller the tire, the lower that breakpoint pressure is going to be.^[https://silca.cc/blogs/silca/tire-pressure-calculator-explained]
