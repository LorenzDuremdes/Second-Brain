1. luminous efficiency function (y(λ) or V(λ)); represents the average spectral sensitivity of [[human]] [[visual perception]] of light^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_efficiency_function]
	1. Different luminous efficiency functions apply under different [[lighting]] conditions, varying from photopic in brightly lit conditions through mesopic to scotopic under low [[lighting]] conditions. **When not specified, the *luminous efficiency function* generally refers to the photopic luminous efficiency function.**
2. the standard luminous efficiency function is normalized to a peak value of unity at 555 nm (see luminous coefficient)^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_efficiency_function#cite_note-Wyszecki2000-8]
	1. the value of y(λ) is 0.999997 at 555.016 nm, so that a value of 683/0.999997 = 683.002 is the multiplicative constant.
	2. **green light at 555 nm** (maximum possible luminous efficacy by definition)^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_efficacy#Examples_2]:
	   - overall luminous efficacy (lm/W) = 683.002
	   - overall luminous efficiency = 100%
