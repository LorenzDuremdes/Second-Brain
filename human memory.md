# improvements
1. what can you do when not being able to recall something?
	1. add more details --> activating more [[memory]] traces
		1. e.g. what lead you to learn about a particular concept (the history beforehand) e.g. arrhythmia after exercise → athletic [[heart]] [[syndrome]]
	2. **related**
		1. [[Levels of Processing model]] --> the higher, the easier (potential) it is to search something (specificity) --> more [[memory]] traces
2. [[memory]] [[speed]] → [[Boolean algebra]]
	1. a higher relative [[memory]] [[speed]] might make "conjunction" more likely?
		1. e.g. bigger [[working memory]] capacity → conjunction? → less creativity (on average)
3. [[oxygen]] → [[memory]]
	1. [[oxygen]] administration enhances [[memory]] formation in healthy young adults
