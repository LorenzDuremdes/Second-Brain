1. sparse distributed memory; the main attribute of the memory is sensitivity to similarity, meaning that a word can be read back not only by giving the original write address but also by giving one close to it, as measured by the number of mismatched bits (i.e., the Hamming distance between memory addresses).^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_distributed_memory#cite_note-book-1]
