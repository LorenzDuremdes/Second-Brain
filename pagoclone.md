1. pagoclone; an [[anxiolytic]] agent from the cyclopyrrolone family, related to better-known drugs such as the sleeping [[medication]] zopiclone
   
   pagoclone belongs to the class of [[nonbenzodiazepine|nonbenzodiazepines]], which have similar effects to the older [[benzodiazepine]] group, but with quite different chemical structures. It was never commercialised.
   
   the pharmacologist David Nutt has suggested pagoclone as a possible base from which to make a better social [[drug]], as it produces the positive effects of alcohol, such as relaxation and sociability, but without also causing the negative effects like aggression, amnesia, nausea, loss of coordination and liver damage^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagoclone]
2. This metabolite has a considerably greater efficacy at the Î±1 subtype than the parent compound and was shown to have significant [[anxiolytic]]-like activity and to produce sedation. In contrast to zopiclone, pagoclone produces [[anxiolytic]] effects with little sedative or amnestic actions at low doses (0.3mg to 1.2mg per day).^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagoclone]

3. Pagoclone is perfect against [[anxiety]]. It really calms you down and gives you a pieceful mindset but nothing more. There's no real high or buzz. Just [[anxiolytic]] properties. Also there are no noticeable side effects.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/jwke9t/pagoclone_general_thoughts/]
