1. pagoclone; an [[anxiolytic]] agent from the cyclopyrrolone family, related to better-known drugs such as the sleeping [[medication]] zopiclone
   
   pagoclone belongs to the class of [[nonbenzodiazepine|nonbenzodiazepines]], which have similar effects to the older [[benzodiazepine]] group, but with quite different chemical structures. It was never commercialised.
   
   the pharmacologist David Nutt has suggested pagoclone as a possible base from which to make a better social [[drug]], as it produces the positive effects of alcohol, such as relaxation and sociability, but without also causing the negative effects like aggression, amnesia, nausea, loss of coordination and liver damage^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagoclone]
