1. The Count of Monte Cristo is a big deconstruction of The Odyssey by Homer. Alexandre Dumas read Homer (Dumas A., Mes Mémoires, Paris, Bouquins, 2003, p. 590.) and the book influenced him.
   
   Edmond is a deconstructed version of Ulysses, Mercedes is a deconstructed version of Penelope, Albert is a deconstructed version of Telemachus, Haydee is a deconstructed version of Princess Nausicaa.
   
   When Edmond returns to [[France]], he discovers that Mercedes has married, that her son is not his, but Fernand's, unlike Ulysses, in which Penelope waits for him and they both have a son who is Telemachus.
   
   If Ulysses was right in his revenge, it is wrong for the Count of Monte Crisot to take revenge. If Ulysses refuses to marry Princess Nausicaa because Penelope is waiting for him, Edmond accepts to marry Haydee.
   
   Ulysses returns home to his family, but Edmond does not feel that France is his home and leaves for the East with Haydee.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1fjsjvc/comment/lnto73n/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]
2. Watched this recently on a whim. Starts off "oh, wait a minute this is quite good" - within 30 minutes "no this is really good" . By an hour in "f@#k me, this is amazing". It's 3 hr film that feels like a 2hr film. Brilliant, more people see it the better.
