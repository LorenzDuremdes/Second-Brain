1. [[energy]] equivalence of [[oxygen]]; refers to how much energy (in kilo[[calorie|calories]]) is derived per liter of Oâ‚‚ consumed
   
   In summary, the relationship between [[respiratory exchange ratio|RER]] and energy equivalence shows that as RER increases, more energy is obtained per liter of oxygen consumed, making [[carbohydrate metabolism]] more oxygen-efficient compared to [[fatty acid metabolism|fat metabolism]].^[ChatGPT]
2. To determine the contribution from [[aerobic exercise|aerobic energy]] production, O<sub>2</sub> values were converted to energy equivalents based on respiratory exchange ratio (RER) values using the conversion tables of Elia and Livesey. This allows RER-specific energy conversions to be used. For example, the energy equivalent of 1 L of O2 is 4.687 kcal at an RER of 0.71, and 5.048 kcal at an RER of 1.0^[[A Novel Method to Predict Carbohydrate and Energy Expenditure During Endurance Exercise Using Measures of Training Load](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-024-02131-z)]
