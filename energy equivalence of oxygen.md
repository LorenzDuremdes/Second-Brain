1. [[energy]] equivalence of [[oxygen]]; refers to how much energy (in kilo[[calorie|calories]]) is derived per liter of O₂ consumed
   
   In summary, the relationship between [[respiratory exchange ratio|RER]] and energy equivalence shows that as RER increases, more energy is obtained per liter of oxygen consumed, making [[carbohydrate metabolism]] more oxygen-efficient compared to [[fatty acid metabolism|fat metabolism]].^[ChatGPT]
2. To determine the contribution from [[aerobic exercise|aerobic energy]] production, O<sub>2</sub> values were converted to energy equivalents based on respiratory exchange ratio (RER) values using the conversion tables of Elia and Livesey. This allows RER-specific energy conversions to be used. For example, the energy equivalent of 1 L of O2 is 4.687 kcal at an RER of 0.71, and 5.048 kcal at an RER of 1.0^[[A Novel Method to Predict Carbohydrate and Energy Expenditure During Endurance Exercise Using Measures of Training Load](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-024-02131-z)]

# [[carbohydrate]]
1. the energy yield from carbohydrate varies depending on the source, with a range from **3.719 kcal/g of glucose to 4.187 kcal/g of glycogen**.
   
   The equations of Jeukendrup and Wallis vary **based on exercise intensity**, assuming 50% of the carbohydrate oxidation is derived from plasma glucose and 50% from muscle glycogen during low-intensity exercise (40–50% O2max), and 20% from glucose and 80% from muscle glycogen at moderate-to-high intensity exercise (50–75% O2max). This results in carbohydrate oxidation yielding 3.95 kcal/g of carbohydrate during low-intensity exercise, and 4.07 kcal/g of carbohydrate during moderate-to-high intensity exercise
   
   The net yield of **anaerobic glycolysis is 2.9 ATP** when starting from glycogen (assuming 90% α-1,4 glycosidic bonds) and 2 ATP when starting from glucose. The **complete oxidation** of glycogen yields 34.35 ATP, and complete oxidation of glucose yields 33.45 ATP. During high-intensity exercise, we assume the substrate for anaerobic glycolysis is glycogen, implying it would require 11.845 times more carbohydrate (because 34.35/2.9 = 11.845) to produce the same amount of ATP via anaerobic, compared with aerobic, metabolism.^[[A Novel Method to Predict Carbohydrate and Energy Expenditure During Endurance Exercise Using Measures of Training Load](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-024-02131-z)]
