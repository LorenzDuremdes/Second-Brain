# microcycle
1. when could "drop sets" not be as beneficial? (road cycling)
	1. when the goal is something associated with metabolic waste e.g. lactate
		1. ◇this won't 'convert' a Z3 into Z4 because of fatigue
		2. ◇"drop sets" could still be effective for Z2, Z3, and Z6
			1. ¬Z5 → need high enough intensity to breath hard (which is more difficult (to maintain) in a more fatigued state)
		3. ◇good → despite Z1 feeling difficult due to fatigue, it still enhances recovery
