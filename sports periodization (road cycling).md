1. [Overload and Overtraining (sdsu.edu)](https://coachsci.sdsu.edu/csa/vol13/rushall7.htm)
	1. He does not allow his swimmers to ever lose [[conditioning]]. There are no days off for recovery.
	   - During the winter he does not like his swimmers to enter many competitions. If there are too many races, then swimmers do not get the opportunity to "set up" properly for racing," which he implied, is an important skill and set of procedures.
	   - Coach Troy's programs are long-term oriented. He wants his swimmers to compete well on only a few identified occasions. He stressed that it is of no value to sacrifice training for lesser level competitions.
	   - Any recovery that occurs is done on an individual basis. There is no planned "team" recovery period.
	   - During a taper or period of rest, Coach Troy and the athlete work together to determine the most successful course of training. He cited the example of how little work Greg Burgess does in the last week of a taper and yet he still performs well in races.
	2. This is not a "survival of the fittest" program for it is remarkable how many young men are able to adapt to the increased volume of high quality work, something which they have never before experienced.
	3. He attempts to program training sessions which avoid excessive debilitating fatigue. Instead of falling into the traditional pattern of training early and late in the day with long sessions, he ensures opportunities for his rowers to get adequate night and between-practice-sessions rest. Recognizing that in a two-hour practice session it is usually the last half-hour that is of the worst quality but the greatest fatigue, he often programs three practice sessions a day, each being approximately one and a half hours. The detrimental latter portion fatigue of the two-hour practice is avoided, the less stressful shorter practices require less recovery between sessions, and so a greater volume of adaptive and quality training is performed each day and across the particular training phase.
# [[microcycle]]
1. when could "drop sets" not be as beneficial? ([[road cycling]])
	1. when the [[goal]] is something associated with metabolic waste e.g. [[lactate]]
		1. ◇this won't 'convert' a Z3 into Z4 because of fatigue
		2. ◇"drop sets" could still be effective for Z2, Z3, and Z6
			1. ¬Z5 → need high enough intensity to breath hard (which is more difficult (to maintain) in a more fatigued state)
		3. ◇good → despite Z1 [[feeling]] difficult due to fatigue, it still enhances recovery

## session
1. why are you not fond of doing Z6 and Z2/3/4/5 in the same session/day/[[microcycle]] etc?
	1. the adaptations are different at Z6 and above (**see**: adaptations chart per zone) and you only have a limited quantity to allocate (which adaptations also depend on e.g. [[task failure]] %)
2. better alternative to "distance/[[time]]" for measuring workload + why^[The [[Time]]-Crunched Cyclist: Race-Winning Fitness in 6 Hours a Week, 3rd Edition, p. 13]
	1. work (calories burned · efficiency), because it much more closely reflects work/[[stress]] e.g. a hilly terrain requires more work despite same distance/[[time]]
		1. efficiency ≈ 20–25% of calories burned

## [[microcycle]]
### deload
1. [[time]]-crunched training program (deload [[microcycle]])
	1. lower intensity while keeping volume the same rather than keeping intensity the same while dropping volume (to maintain fitness while allowing fatigue to drop)^[The [[Time]]-Crunched Cyclist: Race-Winning Fitness in 6 Hours a Week, 3rd Edition, p. 12]
