# [[microcycle]]
1. when could "drop sets" not be as beneficial? ([[road cycling]])
	1. when the [[goal]] is something associated with metabolic waste e.g. [[lactate]]
		1. ◇this won't 'convert' a Z3 into Z4 because of fatigue
		2. ◇"drop sets" could still be effective for Z2, Z3, and Z6
			1. ¬Z5 → need high enough intensity to breath hard (which is more difficult (to maintain) in a more fatigued state)
		3. ◇good → despite Z1 feeling difficult due to fatigue, it still enhances recovery

## session
1. better alternative to "distance/[[time]]" for measuring workload + why^[The [[Time]]-Crunched Cyclist: Race-Winning Fitness in 6 Hours a Week, 3rd Edition, p. 13]
	1. work (calories burned · efficiency), because it much more closely reflects work/stress e.g. a hilly terrain requires more work despite same distance/[[time]]
		1. efficiency ≈ 20–25% of calories burned

### deload
1. [[time]]-crunched training program (deload [[microcycle]])
	1. lower intensity while keeping volume the same rather than keeping intensity the same while dropping volume (to maintain fitness while allowing fatigue to drop)^[The [[Time]]-Crunched Cyclist: Race-Winning Fitness in 6 Hours a Week, 3rd Edition, p. 12]
