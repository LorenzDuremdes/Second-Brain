1. [Overload and Overtraining (sdsu.edu)](https://coachsci.sdsu.edu/csa/vol13/rushall7.htm)
	1. He does not allow his swimmers to ever lose [[conditioning]]. There are no days off for recovery.
	   - During the [[winter]] he does not like his swimmers to enter many competitions. If there are too many races, then swimmers do not get the opportunity to "set up" properly for racing," which he implied, is an important skill and set of procedures.
	   - Coach Troy's programs are long-term oriented. He wants his swimmers to compete well on only a few identified occasions. He stressed that it is of no value to sacrifice training for lesser level competitions.
	   - Any recovery that occurs is done on an individual basis. There is no planned "team" recovery period.
	   - During a taper or period of rest, Coach Troy and the athlete work together to determine the most successful course of training. He cited the example of how little work Greg Burgess does in the last week of a taper and yet he still performs well in races.
	2. This is not a "survival of the fittest" program for it is remarkable how many young [[men]] are able to adapt to the increased volume of high quality work, something which they have never before experienced.
	3. He attempts to program training sessions which avoid excessive debilitating fatigue. Instead of falling into the traditional pattern of training early and late in the day with long sessions, he ensures opportunities for his rowers to get adequate night and between-practice-sessions rest. Recognizing that in a two-hour practice session it is usually the last half-hour that is of the worst quality but the greatest fatigue, he often programs three practice sessions a day, each being approximately one and a half hours. The detrimental latter portion fatigue of the two-hour practice is avoided, the less stressful shorter practices require less recovery between sessions, and so a greater volume of adaptive and quality training is performed each day and across the particular training phase.
2. what should you perhaps do if unable to finish a workout session?
	1. stop it as early as predictable/possible > rest/recover next day > try to continue again the day after > re-adjust workout/programming if still unable to complete
		1. last phase could also be due to e.g. injury/illness rather than just incorrect programming
		2. incorrect programming → e.g. too high ATL
		3. possible algorithm: additive increase / partial multiplicative decrease? e.g. 10 > 20 > 40 > 20 > 30 > 40 > 30 > 35 (in this case, 35 might be sustainable > progress CTL further)
		   
		   or: 10 > 20 > 40 > 20 > 30 > 40 > 30 > 25 (in this case 30 was also too high (for now))
3. how can you know (autoregulation) when an increase in fatigue is unsustainable (reduces CTL) long-term _beforehand_? (Dr. Andrew Coggan and Rushall's training philosophy)
	1. if you are unable to complete a workout in such a way that you can't compensate the TSS later on either
		1. a little (short-term) fatigue (from previous session(s)) might not be bad as long as it doesn't hinder CTL e.g. [[block training]]
			1. i.e. sometimes you just have to continue a little longer (e.g. days) and see what the workouts do rather than being scared of '[[overtraining]]'  
	2. you can estimate this e.g. when a (or the same) workout becomes more difficult to finish over [[time]] → only sustainable short-term
	3. is the idea of Dr. Andrew Coggan's / Rushall's training philosophy to not accumulate any fatigue?
			1. the idea is probably more to have the highest volume (CTL) as well as frequency (as that matters as well), both aimed at maximizing adaptations/performance
				1. e.g. Dr. Andrew Coggan probably accumulated some fatigue during his interval days hence he had to titrate the intensity of his 'moderate-intensity filler days'
2. why shouldn't you have 'major ups/downs' (Dr. Andrew Coggan's / Rushall's training philosophy) > [[sleep]] analogy
	1. once recovered, you can't 'accumulate more recovery' (like with oversleeping) → you have to recover **longer** ([[diminishing returns]]) for extremely hard sessions and after as well (both bringing down e.g. CTL)
# [[mesocycle]]
1. what might be the best current way to decide how long to do the supra-MRV microcycles of block periodization (road cycling)?
	1. try to do as much as possible (with perhaps some 'microcycle pre-exhaust' to maximize adaptations e.g. XSSR) for as many days as possible while meeting conditions such as fasted training (also to maximize adaptations) and see 'when you hit a wall' and stay a little below this the following mesocycles (while ramping it up according to recommended ramp rates)
		1. e.g. rather than trying to be restricted to the 7-day microcycles

# [[microcycle]]
1. when could "drop sets" not be as beneficial? ([[road cycling]])
	1. when the [[goal]] is something associated with metabolic waste e.g. [[lactate]]
		1. ◇this won't 'convert' a Z3 into Z4 because of fatigue
		2. ◇"drop sets" could still be effective for Z2, Z3, and Z6
			1. ¬Z5 → need high enough intensity to breath hard (which is more difficult (to maintain) in a more fatigued state)
		3. ◇good → despite Z1 [[feeling]] difficult due to fatigue, it still enhances recovery

## session
1. why are you not fond of doing Z6 and Z2/3/4/5 in the same session/day/[[microcycle]] etc?
	1. the adaptations are different at Z6 and above (**see**: adaptations chart per zone) and you only have a limited quantity to allocate (which adaptations also depend on e.g. [[task failure]] %)
2. better alternative to "distance/[[time]]" for measuring workload + why^[The [[Time]]-Crunched Cyclist: Race-Winning Fitness in 6 Hours a Week, 3rd Edition, p. 13]
	1. work (calories burned · efficiency), because it much more closely reflects work/[[stress]] e.g. a hilly terrain requires more work despite same distance/[[time]]
		1. efficiency ≈ 20–25% of calories burned

### twice-a-day training
1. how close do 2 exercise sessions have to be to induce greater exercise-induced signaling?
	1. ~2 hours (although they don't mention shorter or a bit longer i.e. optimal timing)
	   
	   Endurance exercise begun with reduced muscle [[glycogen]] stores seems to potentiate [[skeletal muscle]] [[protein]] abundance and [[gene expression]]. However, it is unknown whether this greater signaling responses is due to performing two exercise sessions in close proximity—as a first exercise session is necessary to reduce the muscle [[glycogen]] stores. In the present study, we manipulated the recovery duration between a first muscle [[glycogen]]-depleting exercise and a second exercise session, such that the second exercise session started with reduced muscle [[glycogen]] in both approaches but was performed either **2 or 15 hours after the first exercise session** (so-called “twice-a-day” and “once-daily” approaches, respectively). We found that exercise twice-a-day increased the nuclear abundance of [[transcription factor]] EB (TFEB) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and potentiated the transcription of [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor]]-ɣ coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor]]-alpha (PPARα), and [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor]] beta/delta (PPARβ/δ) genes, in comparison with the once-daily exercise. These results suggest that part of the elevated molecular signaling reported with previous “train-low” approaches might be attributed to performing two exercise sessions in close proximity. **The twice-a-day approach might be an effective strategy to induce adaptations related to [[mitochondrial biogenesis]] and [[lipid metabolism|fat oxidation]].**
	   
	   In summary, our findings indicate that the **greater exercise-induced signaling with the so-called “train-low” approach in our study can partially be attributed to the performance of two exercise sessions in close succession** <u>rather than exercising with a reduced muscle [[glycogen]] content</u>. We presented evidence that performing two exercise sessions separated by a short recovery period increases the nuclear abundance of TFEB and NFAT and potentiates the transcription of PGC-1α, PPARα, and PPARβ/δ.^[[Exercise twice‐a‐day potentiates markers of mitochondrial biogenesis in men - Andrade‐Souza - 2020 - The FASEB Journal - Wiley Online Library](https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1096/fj.201901207RR)]

## timing of the day
1. MFO, Fatmax and VO2max were significantly higher in the afternoon than in the morning (all P < 0.05). Compared to the placebo, [[caffeine]] increased mean MFO by 10.7% (0.28 ± 0.10 vs. 0.31 ± 0.09 g/min respectively, P < 0.001) in the morning, and by a mean 29.0% (0.31 ± 0.09 vs. 0.40 ± 0.10 g/min, P < 0.001) in the afternoon. [[Caffeine]] also increased mean Fatmax by 11.1% (36.9 ± 14.4 (placebo) vs. 41.0 ± 13.1%, P = 0.005) in the morning, and by 13.1% (42.0 ± 11.6 vs. 47.5 ± 10.8%, P = 0.008) in the afternoon.^[[Caffeine increases maximal fat oxidation during a graded exercise test: is there a diurnal variation? - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33413459/)]
   
   Peak power (P(peak)), mean power (P(mean)), total work done, and .VO(2) increased significantly from morning to afternoon during the Wingate Test. As a consequence, aerobic contribution recorded during the test increased from morning to afternoon. However, no difference in [[blood]] [[lactate]] concentrations was observed from morning to afternoon. Furthermore, power decrease was greater in the morning than afternoon. Altogether, these results indicate that the [[time]]-of-day effect on performances during the Wingate test is mainly due to better aerobic participation in [[energy]] production during the test in the afternoon than in the morning.^[[Effect of time of day on aerobic contribution to the 30-s Wingate test performance - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17701684/)]
