1. Its founder, Carl Rogers, writes:
   
   The central hypothesis of this approach can be briefly stated. It is that the individual has within him or her [[self]] vast resources for [[self]]-understanding, for altering her or his [[self-concept]], attitudes, and [[self]]-directed behaviour—and that these resources can be tapped if only a definable climate of facilitative psychological attitudes can be provided.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconditional_positive_regard#cite_note-Rogers-Kutash-2]

# quotes
1. “People are just as wonderful as sunsets if you let them be. When I look at a sunset, I don't find myself saying, "Soften the orange a bit on the right hand corner." I don't try to control a sunset. I watch with awe as it unfolds.” —Carl Rogers
2. “In my early professional years I was asking the question: How can I treat, or cure, or change this person? Now I would phrase the question in this way: How can I provide a relationship which this person may use for his own personal growth?”
