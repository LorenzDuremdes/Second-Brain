1. eusociality; the highest level of organization of [sociality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociality)
2. **Image**: Co-operative brood rearing, seen here in honeybees, is a condition of eusociality.

3. Eusociality is distinguished from all other social systems because individuals of at least one caste usually lose the ability to perform at least one behavior characteristic of individuals in another caste.

# Characteristics
1. cooperative [brood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring) care (including care of offspring from other individuals)
2. overlapping generations within a colony of adults
3. a division of labor into reproductive and non-reproductive groups
	1. The division of labor creates specialized behavioral groups within an [[animal]] society which are sometimes called [castes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castes)

# Humans
1. are humans eusocial? + why
	1. potentially yes e.g. suicide, homosexuality, menopause^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusociality#In_humans]
	2. no, because one caste does not lose one ability (e.g. reproduction)^[https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/bm998i/are_humans_eusocial_creatures/]

# Paradox
1. why was "eusociality" seen as a paradox?
	1. Prior to the [gene-centered view of evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene-centered_view_of_evolution), eusociality was seen as an apparent evolutionary paradox: if adaptive [[evolution]] unfolds by differential reproduction of individual organisms, how can individuals incapable of passing on their genes evolve and persist?
2. why is "eusociality" and the "non-reproductive caste" not a paradox?
	1. After the [[gene]]-centered view of evolution was developed in the mid 1970s, non-reproductive individuals were seen as an extended phenotype of the genes, which are the primary beneficiaries of natural selection.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusociality#cite_note-52]
