1. how long is a [[microcycle]]?
	1. depends on e.g. when it becomes [[nonfunctional overreaching]] due to being too long?
	2. e.g. a push-pull-legs would be a 3-day [[microcycle]]^[https://youtu.be/zbcUtV5VHDc?t=1440]

# [[endurance training]]
1. increasing [[Training Stress Score|TSS]] budget by doing lots of Z2 (e.g. lower TSS/[[calorie]]) with occasional e.g. Z5 for [[principle of specificity]] vs. doing lots of e.g. SST with Z1 between the days + why
	1. the latter might be more effective e.g. even more principle of specificity (unless you are training for [[ultra-distance cycling]], although Dr. Andrew Coggan did races of 5+ hours as well with his relatively short daily trainings) or [[Chronic Intensity Load|CIL]] (as well as e.g. strengthening joints/tendons more)
	   
	   doing lots of Z2 in between produces fatigue as well (as it requires a lot of hours for it to be effective in well-trained cyclists (see: Dr. Andrew Coggan)), which can impede next-day performance
