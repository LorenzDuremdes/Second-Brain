1. [[consciousness]] ↮ [[self]]-awareness^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness#cite_note-3]
	1. while [[consciousness]] is being aware of one's environment and body and lifestyle, [[self]]-awareness is the recognition of that awareness
2. [[self]]-awareness → interpersonal judgments
	1. less [[self]]-aware people tend to judge others more (likely)^[Dr. Alok Kanojia (Wednesday 8 June 2022)]
		1. why? ◇because the brain (mostly left cerebral hemisphere) tries to rationalize actions/thoughts/stimuli... (if it can't do this from 'self', it will try to do it somewhere else e.g. others)
