1. do people with psychopathy have big egos?
	1. yes, but it's not dependent on other people nor are they trying to "hide their weaknesses (unless that's beneficial, but not due to insecurity)"
	2. i.e. they are accurate in their strengths and weaknesses

1. can psychopaths raise children well?^[https://qr.ae/pGjw1b, Athena Walker]
	1. some can (just like neurotypicals)

## advantages
1. I have [[empathy]] issues where I could in theory do that, it's terrifying it turns out if I wanted to choose to harm I could do these kind of decisions.

	Fortunatly I try to use it for good, for keeping calm and composed even if the topic is heavy and trying to choose what is more beneficial for people always. (rather what others sometimes do which is harmful but "feels" like the right thing)
	
	I have not zero emotions, but it's easy for me to "stop them" if it's a necessity^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wzeb1c/comment/im3n9uy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
