1. baryon; a type of composite subatomic particle which contains an odd number of valence quarks (at least 3).^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon#cite_note-Gell-Mann_1964-1]
	1. the most familiar baryons are **protons** and **neutrons**, both of which contain three quarks, and for this reason they are sometimes called *triquarks*

		because they are composed of quarks, baryons participate in the **strong interaction**, which is mediated by particles known as **gluons**
