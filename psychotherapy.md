# session
1. introductory session > possible goals (psychotherapy):
	1. symptoms
	2. development of the symptoms (e.g. [[history]], beginning)
	3. patient's desired changes
2. [[Dr. David McPhee]]'s response on "What would you think about this? I asked my psychotherapist if he ever feels that I'm a burden to him and he admitted that he does sometimes feel burdened by me because of how sensitive and easily hurt I am. Should I stop seeing him?"^[https://qr.ae/pGFNxc]
	1. My first reaction on reading your question was “No. You’ve found someone who cares enough to be clear and honest with you, even when it can make you uncomfortable.”
	2. You asked a question and got an honest answer that can help you, not some polite baloney.

## negativity
1. how does a good psychotherapist handle clients 'mistreating' them (e.g. insults)?^[https://qr.ae/pG6TKd]
	1. I am not ‘enduring’ anything — I am not a put-upon unrewarded servant, forced to endure disrespect. I am an ambitious professional whose sense of [[feeling]] respected does not depend on how each individual client is going to address me. It is my responsibility, not my clients’, to create a life for myself in which I feel dignified and rewarded.
2. an emotionally-grounded therapist would take an insult in stride and explore the client’s [[motivation]] for making it.^[https://qr.ae/pG6NMq]
3. People don’t come to [[therapy]] because they are happy and everything is going well in their life. They have patterns of [[communication]] that are often dysfunctional, and we get that.^[https://qr.ae/pG6NuC]

1. none of the professional organizations code of ethics (i.e., APA, ApA, ACA, NASW, CAMFT) view touch as unethical[https://www.zurinstitute.com/clinical-updates/touch-in-therapy/]

## Alok Kanojia
1. why does "Alok Kanojia" often ask "how does that make you feel?"
