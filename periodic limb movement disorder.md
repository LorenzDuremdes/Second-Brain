1. periodic limb movement disorder; a [[sleep disorder]] where the patient moves limbs involuntarily and periodically during [[sleep]], and has symptoms or problems related to the movement
   
   PLMD should not be confused with [[restless legs syndrome]] (RLS), which is characterized by a voluntary response to an urge to move legs due to discomfort. PLMD on the other hand is involuntary, and the patient is often unaware of these movements altogether.
   
   These movements can lead the patient to wake up, and if so, [[sleep]] interruption can be the origin of [[excessive daytime sleepiness]].^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_limb_movement_disorder]
