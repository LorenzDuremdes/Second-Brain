1. **Training Stress Score**; a composite number that takes into account the duration and intensity of a workout to arrive at a single estimate of the overall training load and physiological stress created by that training session
	1. By definition, one hour spent at [[functional threshold power]] (FTP) is equal to 100 points.^[https://help.trainingpeaks.com/hc/en-us/articles/204071944-Training-Stress-Scores-TSS-Explained]
		1. maximum? → can go higher e.g. "drop sets"
	2. **related**: [[allostatic load]]
2. training stress score = %FTP*duration (h)^[https://cyklopedia.cc/cycling-tips/what-is-training-stress-score-tss-cycling/]
	1. e.g.:
if you are planning to go easy for 2 hours, around 70% of your FTP (IF 0.70) just square 0.70 and multiplay by 100, it gives you 49 TSS per hour, the total for the workout will be 98 TSS
3. Garmin’s “Training Load” is based on Rusko’s EPOC^[Dr. Andrew Coggan: https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/is-tss-a-useful-metric-for-mixed-difficulty-training/89497/2?u=lorenz_duremdes]
	1. EPOC; [[excess post-exercise oxygen consumption]]

# [[carbohydrate metabolism]]
1. Repeated-measures correlation values with 95% confidence intervals between training load measures and [[carbohydrate]] (CHO, top) and [[energy]] use (bottom) from the primary study. HR heart rate, sRPE-TL session [[rating of perceived exertion (RPE)|rating of perceived exertion]] training load, TRIMP training impulse, TSS training stress score, TSS-HR TSS calculated with heart rate, TWD-kJ total work done (kJ)
   
   All measures of training load were significantly different for each training session, except total carbohydrate utilization and TSS, which were not different between LIT-long and HIIT-short, and TWD-kJ, which was not different between HIIT-long and LIT-long.
   
   TSS was the only measure of training load to accurately reflect similar total carbohydrate utilization between the longer duration low-intensity session and the shorter duration high-intensity session^[[A Novel Method to Predict Carbohydrate and Energy Expenditure During Endurance Exercise Using Measures of Training Load (2024)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-024-02131-z)]
