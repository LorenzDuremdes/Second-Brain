1. floating-point arithmetic; using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation to support a [[trade-off]] between range and precision
	1. For this reason, floating-point computation is often found in systems which include very small and very large real numbers, which require fast processing times.
2. floating-point arithmetic makes use of minima and maxima
	1. space-[[time]] tradeoff:
		1. change in space - change in [[time]] = 0
