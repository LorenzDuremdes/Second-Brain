1. maceration ([[cooking]]); the process of preparing [[food|foods]] through the softening or breaking into pieces using a [[liquid]].
   
   Sometimes a cooking [[oil]] is used as the liquid for maceration – especially [[olive oil|olive]] or some other vegetable oil.
   
   Maceration is often confused with [[marination]], which is the process of soaking foods in a [[seasoning|seasoned]], often [[acid|acidic]], liquid before cooking.
   
   The word maceration comes from Latin macerare, which means "to soften" or "to steep". It entered English in the mid-1500s referring to the wasting of flesh.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maceration_(cooking)]
   
   Macerate, from Latin, “to soften,” refers to the process whereby ingredients soak in some form of acid—usually vinegar or [[citrus]] juice—to soften their harshness. Simply coat the [[shallot|shallots]] or [[onion|onions]] in acid—they don’t need to be completely submerged. If you plan on using a couple of tablespoons of [[vinegar]] for a dressing, just coat the shallots with it first, and wait 15 or 20 minutes before adding oil to build the dressing in the same cup or bowl. It will be enough to prevent dragon breath.^[Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking (Samin Nosrat), p. 164]
