1. highest response ratio next (HRRN); processes that have spent a long time waiting compete against those estimated to have short run times. If the waiting time of a process increases, it's response ratio increases making the long awaited process to execute next.
2. this [[algorithm]] solves the starvation problem that exists in [[shortest remaining time first|SRTF]] scheduling [[algorithm]]
3. do "important and urgent" first makes use of the [[algorithm]] "highest response ratio next"^[Algorithms to Live By: The [[computer science]] of Human Decisions, p. 117]
4. how does "highest response ratio" handle new incoming tasks?
	1. each time a new piece of work comes in, divide its importance by the amount of time it will take to complete. If that figure is higher than for the task youâ€™re currently doing, switch to the new one; otherwise stick with the current task^[Algorithms to Live By: The [[computer science]] of Human Decisions, p. 126]
