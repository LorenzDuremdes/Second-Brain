1. Topaz Labs workflow (personal preference) + why
	1. Denoise > Gigapixel > Sharpen (doing Sharpen before Gigapixel results in too many artifacts (e.g. around tree tops))
	2. What no one discusses is that Gigapixel sharpens the photo, so my advice is run it through Gigapixel first before considering Sharpen^[https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/wjg4t5/comment/ijlpfjt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
