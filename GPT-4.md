   GPT-4 is a large multimodal model developed by OpenAI that accepts both image and text inputs and generates text outputs. It exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, although it is still less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios ^[https://openai.com/research/gpt-4]. GPT-4 has a broader general [[knowledge]] and improved problem-solving abilities compared to its predecessors, making it more creative and collaborative. It can generate, edit, and iterate with users on creative and technical writing tasks, such as composing songs, writing screenplays, or learning a user's writing style ^[https://openai.com/product/gpt-4?ref=louis-bouchard].
   
   OpenAI has published research papers and updates about GPT-4 on its website. Some recent research topics include forecasting potential misuses of [[language]] models for disinformation campaigns and how to reduce risk ^[https://openai.com/]^[https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/]. OpenAI also provides a system card detailing GPT-4's behavior and moderation API trigger rates, showcasing the improvements in the model compared to its predecessors^[https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4-system-card.pdf].

2. how "GPT-4 has a broader general [[knowledge]] and improved problem-solving abilities"?
   GPT-4's broader general [[knowledge]] and improved problem-solving abilities can be attributed to the advancements in its architecture, training data, and fine-tuning processes compared to its predecessors. While I don't have specific details about GPT-4's architecture, I can provide a general understanding based on the GPT series of models.
   
   Larger training dataset: GPT-4 is trained on an even larger dataset than its predecessor, [[GPT-3]]. This means that it has access to a more diverse range of text sources, allowing it to learn various topics, styles, and nuances in human [[language]]. This broader exposure to [[information]] enables GPT-4 to have a wider general [[knowledge]] base.
   
   More parameters: GPT-4 has more parameters than [[GPT-3]], which means that it has a larger capacity to learn and store [[information]]. This increased capacity enables GPT-4 to develop a deeper understanding of [[language]] patterns and relationships, as well as the context in which words and phrases are used. This results in better problem-solving abilities, as the model can make more accurate predictions based on the input it receives.
   
   Fine-tuning and training techniques: Advances in fine-tuning and training techniques can also contribute to GPT-4's improved performance. These techniques may include new strategies for optimizing the model's parameters or handling biases, as well as incorporating new learning techniques or loss functions to better align the model's predictions with human values and expectations.
   
   Together, these factors contribute to GPT-4's broader general [[knowledge]] and improved problem-solving abilities, making it more creative and collaborative when working with users on creative and technical writing tasks.^[GPT-4]
3. Query: how much larger is "GPT-4 training dataset"?
   The provided search results do not offer specific [[information]] about the size of GPT-4's training dataset. However, one of the search results suggests that GPT-4 could have as many as 100 trillion parameters, which would be 500 times the size of [[GPT-3]]'s 175 billion parameters^[https://towardsdatascience.com/gpt-4-will-have-100-trillion-parameters-500x-the-size-of-gpt-3-582b98d82253]. While this is about the number of parameters, it indicates that GPT-4's training dataset would likely be significantly larger than [[GPT-3]]'s dataset. The exact size of GPT-4's training dataset remains unknown based on the [[information]] provided.
