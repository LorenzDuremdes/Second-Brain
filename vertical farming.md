## Structure
A new vertical farm – Nordic Harvest – will be Europe's largest and most efficient when fully completed in late 2021. The indoor facility is being equipped with robotics, hydroponics, arrays of 20,000 LEDs, smart software and other technologies for processing more than 5,000 individual data points. It will run entirely on wind power, slashing the [[carbon]] footprint of production.

Vertical farming is expensive, however, with large upfront capital costs, and a number of technical challenges involving the artificial [[lighting]], automation and watering processes. Most companies operating such facilities have been unprofitable. The project at Nordic Harvest is aiming to change that.

## Production Capacity
Production will begin during the first quarter of 2021 and profits are projected within the first year, which could make this vertical farm a model of feasibility for the industry at large. The financial projections are based on a scale-up model, which will see the farm expanded from an initial 200-tonne annual capacity to a massive 1,000-tonne annual capacity by the fourth quarter of 2021.

Crop yields with vertical farming have the potential to be orders of magnitude greater per unit area than traditional field farms. One recent study found that wheat grown using a 10-layer indoor vertical farm could, in theory, have a yield between 220 and 600 times higher than current methods.

## Potential Benefits of Vertical Farming
Vertical farms could be a highly disruptive industry in the future, potentially revolutionising [[food]] production. Just some of the advantages offered by this new and emerging technology include: reliable, year-round crop production; plants unaffected by adverse weather or climate; better use of space; minimal [[water]] usage; zero chemicals or pesticides; and reduced transport costs.
