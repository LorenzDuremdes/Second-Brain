1. [[germane cognitive load]] â†’ [[Levels of Processing model]]
	1. the more efficient the [[germane cognitive load]], the higher the levels-of-processing effect
		1. e.g. adding images / reducing extraneous/[[intrinsic cognitive load]]
2. [[bandwidth (computing)]]*e-learning (theory)=[[germane cognitive load]]
