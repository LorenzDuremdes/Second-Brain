1. fuzzy logic; a form of many-valued logic in which the truth value of variables may be any real number between 0 and 1
2. The fuzzy perspective differs by introducing an infinite number of truth-values along a spectrum between perfect truth and perfect falsity.

Borderline cases are thought of as having a "truth-value" anywhere between 0 and 1 (for example, 0.6)^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagueness]
