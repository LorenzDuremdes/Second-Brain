1. When a colony of ants is confronted with the choice of reaching their food via two different routes of which one is much shorter than the other, their choice is entirely random. However, those who use the shorter route reach the food faster and therefore go back and forth more often between the anthill and the food.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms#cite_note-1]^[By Jean-Baptiste Waldner - SourceÂ : &quot;Nanocomputers and Swarm Intelligence&quot;, Jean-Baptiste Waldner, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008., CC BY 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=3435721]
