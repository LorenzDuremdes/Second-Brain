# treatment
## short-term
1. why does focusing on the present alleviate anxiety?^[[Alok Kanojia](https://youtu.be/qvaB2d5yDf8?t=660)]
	1. because anxiety is future-oriented
	2. **related**
		1. consciousness (being occupied by the present instead)

## general
1. improve the following:^[https://qr.ae/pNyfyf (Franklin Veaux)]
	1. How can I get past being scared and awkward? → I feel scared and awkward; how can I move in the direction I want to go anyway?
		1. The answer is, face down the fear. **Don't find a way to magically make it go away so you can interact with people**; interact with people even though you're scared, and the [[feeling]] loses its power over you.
			1. **personal**: reducing [[cerebral cortex|cortex]]-based anxiety beforehand
2. "identifying, expressing, and communicating [[feeling|feelings]]" → anxiety disorders
	1. the former is an essential part for recovering from the latter
	2. it is just as important as relaxation, desensitization, and the cognitive skills discussed in previous chapters
		1. e.g. reducing [[neural competition]]
3. how could trying to prepare for something you are anxious about backfire?
	1. making yourself think it's a very big thing requiring lots of preparation
		1. sometimes it's just a matter of the basics (e.g. anti-anxiety techniques → e.g. 4-7-8 breathing) and doing it

				1. [[amygdala-based anxiety]]

# [[developmental psychopathology]]
1. what does the book "The anxiety and Phobia Workbook, p. 11" think causes anxiety disorders mainly?
	1. stress accumulating over time
		1. which can also result in *inter alia* addictive disorders, [[depression]], and the increased incidence of degenerative disease
	2. **related**: [[allostatic load]]

# fysiology

# [[psychology]]
1. is it common to not feel anxious when engaging in an activity you felt anxious about (e.g. approaching girls)?^[[Alok Kanojia](https://youtu.be/qvaB2d5yDf8?t=780)]
	1. yes, because you are focusing on the present (anxiety focuses on the future)

# examples
1. give an example of "being anxious about the past"^[[Alok Kanojia on anxiety](https://youtu.be/qvaB2d5yDf8?t=240)]
	1. e.g. worrying you said something dumb
	2. how is anxiety projected into the future even when "being anxious about the past"?
		1. the possible consequences e.g. worrying you said something dumb and its possible **future** consequences (future=everything beyond that memory)
