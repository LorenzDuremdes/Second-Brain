1. shortcrust [[pastry]]; usually call for twice as much [[flour]] as [[fat]] by weight
   
   [[Fat]] (as [[lard]], [[shortening]], [[butter]] or traditional [[margarine]]) is rubbed into plain flour to create a loose mixture that is then bound using a small amount of ice [[water]], rolled out, then shaped and placed to create the top or bottom of a pie. Often, equal amounts of butter and lard are used to make the pastry, ensuring that the combined weight of the two fat products is still half that of the flour. The butter is employed to give the pastry a rich flavor, while the lard ensures optimum texture.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortcrust_pastry]
2. Short [[dough|doughs]] are the epitome of tenderness, crumbling and melting in your mouth. Here, flour and fat are blended together intimately, resulting in a smooth, homogeneous dough.Many of the shortest recipes, such as shortbread cookies, call for very soft or even melted butter, in order to encourage this now fluid fat to quickly coat individual flour particles, preventing [[gluten]] webs from forming.^[Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking (Samin Nosrat), p. 127]
