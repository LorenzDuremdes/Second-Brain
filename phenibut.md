6. first experience phenibut (thursday 11/7/2024):
	1. you felt very calm and somewhat euphoric (like with [[bromazolam]]) + it calmed your SNS as well (including high [[heart rate]] and [[blood pressure]])
	2. very fatigued (but sadly doesn't knock you out)
	3. turned you into a supersleeper with [[MK-677]] (only 4 hours of [[sleep]] and [[subjective sleep quality|feeling somewhat physically and mentally rested]] e.g. high [[motivation]] + low RHR/BP))

# research
1. phenibut acts as a full [[agonist]] of the GABAB receptor, similarly to baclofen.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenibut]
	1. [[Total sleep time]] was significantly prolonged by baclofen (placebo 356 +/- 9.9 SEM min; baclofen 386 +/- 9.9 min). Both nonrapid eye movement(REM) and [[REM sleep]] duration were increased (nonREM: placebo 295 +/- 6.8 min; baclofen 311 +/- 8.9 min; REM: placebo 61 +/- 7.5 min; baclofen 76 +/- 9.0 min). Time spent awake after [[sleep onset latency|sleep onset]] was reduced after baclofen (placebo 71 +/- 10.3 min; baclofen 51 +/- 9.7 min).^[[The effects of the GABA agonist, baclofen, on sleep and breathing - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7758556/)]
