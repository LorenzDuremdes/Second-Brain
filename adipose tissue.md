1. how many calories is 1 kg of [[human]] [[fat]]? ~7700 kcal
   
   Likewise, the [[energy]] content of weight change (ES/ΔW) is not constant at 3500 kcal/lb but is changing over [[time]]. Values are substantially less than 3500 kcal/lb during the early rapid weight loss phase and approach 3500 kcal/lb or 7700 kcal/g during the second slower weight loss phase. Both [[fat]] and lean tissues are lost and do so in a predictable way as the body remodels to a new weight loss plateau.Likewise, the [[energy]] content of weight change (E<sub>S</sub>/ΔW) is not constant at 3500 kcal/lb but is changing over [[time]].
