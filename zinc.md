1. Zn2+ exists predominantly in the presynaptic vesicles of [[glutamatergic neuron|glutamatergic neurons]] to be co-released with [[glutamate (neurotransmitter)|glutamate]]^[[Dietary Zinc Acts as a Sleep Modulator - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5713303/)]

## [[sleep]]
1. zinc → sleep
	1. orally administered zinc increases the [[total sleep time|amount]] and the [[sleep quality|quality of sleep]] in mice and humans^[[Dietary Zinc Acts as a Sleep Modulator - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5713303/)]
2. zinc → locomoter activity
	1. feeding the mice with zinc-containing yeast extract (equivalent to a dose of 10 to 160 mg/kg of elemental zinc) at the onset of the dark phase resulted in a drastic reduction of locomotor activity for a period of up to 6 h ... In other words, zinc never induced sleep beyond the physiological level, contrary to more classical [[somnifacient|sleep-inducing molecules]] such as [[benzodiazepine]], which also reduce the power density of [[non-rapid eye movement sleep|NREM sleep]] and result in poor sleep quality. It is possible that zinc acts on [[zeitgeber|circadian regulators]] and induces sleep when the animal is usually sleeping.^[[Dietary Zinc Acts as a Sleep Modulator - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5713303/)]
3. local zinc concentration may be less stable in the [[central nervous system|CNS]] than one would expect. Indeed, it was also reported that plasma zinc concentration, while being tightly controlled by diverse mechanisms, exhibits a [[circadian rhythm|circadian variation]], with a minimum concentration measured in the evening while it reaches its peak in the morning. Similarly, we hypothesize that the zinc concentration also varies in some specific regions of the CNS during the course of a day.^[[Dietary Zinc Acts as a Sleep Modulator - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5713303/)]
