1. zinc → sleep
	1. orally administered zinc increases the [[total sleep time|amount]] and the [[sleep quality|quality of sleep]] in mice and humans^[[Dietary Zinc Acts as a Sleep Modulator - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5713303/)]
2. zinc → locomoter activity
	1. feeding the mice with zinc-containing yeast extract (equivalent to a dose of 10 to 160 mg/kg of elemental zinc) at the onset of the dark phase resulted in a drastic reduction of locomotor activity for a period of up to 6 h ... In other words, zinc never induced sleep beyond the physiological level, contrary to more classical [[somnifacient|sleep-inducing molecules]] such as [[benzodiazepine]], which also reduce the power density of [[non-rapid eye movement sleep|NREM sleep]] and result in poor sleep quality. It is possible that zinc acts on [[zeitgeber|circadian regulators]] and induces sleep when the animal is usually sleeping.^[[Dietary Zinc Acts as a Sleep Modulator - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5713303/)]
