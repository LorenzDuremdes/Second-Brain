1. *"Good cooks know how. Great cooks know why."* â€•Serious Eats (founded by cef J. Kenji Lopez-Alt author of The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science)
2. I was going to say seasoning for sure, I remember Casey Thompson saying the difference between a great [[dish]] and a dish that can send you packing can literally come down to a flake of [[salt]].^[https://www.reddit.com/r/TopChef/comments/16m1rsz/best_advice_from_top_chef/]
3. how can you estimate whether a seasoning will pair well without throwing it in?
	1. Smell the seasoning you want to add while tasting. It's the opposite effect of plugging your nose so you don't [[taste]] things. The [[flavor|flavors]] will combine and you'll know if the seasoning is going to work before adding it.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15ivs8/comment/c7mwhx5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]
4. how should you cook vegetables professionally?
	1. Don't boil. Nothing ruins a veggie faster than boiling.
	   
	   If you want moist veggies, steam them. Then you can sprinkle them with a seasoning, or sautee them with some garlic or ginger and s&p. [[Butter]] will make them delicious but less healthy, [[olive oil]] for more healthy but less delicious.
	   
	   If you want them dry, roast them. Broccoli, carrots, cabbage, beets, cauliflower, and a lot more taste great roasted. Just google a recipe for whichever veg you have. Or put a bunch on a sheet pan and roast them together. I often do a sheet pan dinner with sausages, brussels, carrots and onions, and toss it with a little honey mustard at the end.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/1enea76/how_do_i_cook_veggies_the_healthy_way/]

# [[salt]]
1. The best advice I've gotten is that the main two differences between a restaurant chef and a home cook, other than training and basic cooking knowledge/skills, is that the chef will season (salt) much more generously.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15ivs8/comment/c7mxaow/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]
