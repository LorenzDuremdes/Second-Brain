2. I was going to say seasoning for sure, I remember Casey Thompson saying the difference between a great [[dish]] and a dish that can send you packing can literally come down to a flake of [[salt]].^[https://www.reddit.com/r/TopChef/comments/16m1rsz/best_advice_from_top_chef/]
3. how can you estimate whether a seasoning will pair well without throwing it in?
	1. Smell the seasoning you want to add while tasting. It's the opposite effect of plugging your nose so you don't [[taste]] things. The [[flavor|flavors]] will combine and you'll know if the seasoning is going to work before adding it.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15ivs8/comment/c7mwhx5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]
4. how should you cook vegetables professionally?
	1. Don't boil. Nothing ruins a veggie faster than boiling.
	   
	   If you want moist veggies, steam them. Then you can sprinkle them with a seasoning, or sautee them with some garlic or ginger and s&p. [[Butter]] will make them delicious but less healthy, [[olive oil]] for more healthy but less delicious.
	   
	   If you want them dry, roast them. Broccoli, carrots, cabbage, beets, cauliflower, and a lot more taste great roasted. Just google a recipe for whichever veg you have. Or put a bunch on a sheet pan and roast them together. I often do a sheet pan dinner with sausages, brussels, carrots and onions, and toss it with a little honey mustard at the end.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/1enea76/how_do_i_cook_veggies_the_healthy_way/]

# [[salt]]
1. I can’t prescribe precise amounts of salt for blanching water for a few reasons: I don’t know what size your pot is, how much water you’re using, how much food you’re blanching, or what type of salt you’re using. All of these variables will dictate how much salt to use, and even they may change each time you cook. Instead, **season your cooking water until it’s as salty as the sea (or more accurately, your memory of the sea. At 3.5 percent salinity, seawater is much, much saltier than anyone would ever want to use for cooking)**. You might flinch upon seeing just how much salt this takes, but remember, most of the salt ends up going down the drain. The goal is to create a salty enough environment to allow the salt to diffuse throughout the ingredient during the time it spends in the water.
   
   Salt meats that are going to be cooked in water, like any meats, in advance, but **season the cooking liquids for stews, braises, and poached meats conservatively—keep in mind that you’ll be consuming any salt you add here.** While some salt may leach from the seasoned meat into the less savory broth, it will have already done its important tenderizing work. Anticipate the flavor exchange that will happen between the seasoned meat and its cooking liquid, and taste and adjust the liquid, along with the meat, before serving.^[Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking, p. 61–63]

   The best advice I've gotten is that the main two differences between a restaurant chef and a home cook, other than training and basic cooking knowledge/skills, is that the chef will season (salt) much more generously.

   SALT. My god salt your food. If there is one mistake that home cooks make, and then wonder why it doesn't taste as good as a restaurant, it is usually too little salt. Salt opens up the receptors on your tongue and enhances the flavor of pretty much everything.
   
   Easiest example is salting the water you would use to boil any starch (pasta, potatoes, etc). You should put a lot of salt in the water. Think about how much you would consider a lot, then double it, and add that much. This is the best time to season any starch, when it is boiling. Then adjust the flavor (add more) if needed once it is cooked.
