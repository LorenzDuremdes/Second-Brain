   Trazodone **slightly improves** subjective [[sleep]] quality (standardized mean difference = –0.34 to –0.41) and reduces the number of nighttime awakenings (MD = –0.31, SMD = –0.51), on average. Conversely, it **does not appear to affect** [[sleep onset latency|sleep onset]], [[total sleep time]], [[wake after sleep onset|time awake after sleep onset]], or [[sleep efficiency]].
   
   It **appears to increase [[NREM sleep|deep sleep]]**—in contrast to certain other hypnotics.
   
   The American Academy of [[Sleep]] Medicine's 2017 clinical practice guidelines **recommended against the use of trazodone** in the treatment of [[insomnia]] due to inadequate evidence and due to harms potentially outweighing benefits.
