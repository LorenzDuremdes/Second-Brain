1. how can you make an emulsion more stable?
	1. When an emulsion breaks, the [[fat]] and [[water]] molecules begin to coalesce back into their own troops. In order make an emulsion more stable, use an [[emulsifier]] to coat the [[oil]] and allow it to exist contentedly among the [[vinegar]] droplets. An [[emulsifier]] is like a third link in the chain, a mediator attracting and uniting two formerly hostile parties. [[mustard (condiment)|Mustard]] often plays the role of emulsifier in a [[vinaigrette]], while in a [[mayonnaise]], the [[yolk|egg yolk]] itself has some emulsifying qualities.^[Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking (Samin Nosrat), p. 117]
	2. what should you do when whisking together an imulsion and noticing things start to head south?
		1. In the future, if, while whisking together any emulsion, you notice things start to head south, keep these tips in mind. First, as soon as you suspect that you are on shaky ground, stop adding fat. If the emulsion isn’t thickening and the tines of the whisk aren’t leaving visible tracks, then for heaven’s sake stop adding oil! Sometimes, all that’s called for at this point is a good strong whisking to bring things back together.
		   
		   You can also add a few chips of ice along with the first whiffs of doubt. If you don’t have ice on hand, a tiny splash of cold water from the tap will suffice to regulate [[temperature]] and keep the peace.^[Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking (Samin Nosrat), p. 123]
		   
		   If the [[mixture]] gets too warm, the emulsifier's structure begins to denature or the fat becomes too fluid, making it hard to stabilize.^[ChatGPT]
