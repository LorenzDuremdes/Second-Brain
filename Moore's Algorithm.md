1. Moore's [[Algorithm]]; use "[[prioritization#^e65d2d|Earliest Due Date]]" until a threshold is (estimated) to become exceeded → item taking the largest amount of resources (e.g. time) is discarded^[Algorithms to Live By: The [[computer science]] of Human Decisions, p. 116]
	1. goal → minimizing the quantity of items exceeding threshold
