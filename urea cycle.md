1. urea cycle; a cycle of biochemical reactions that produces [[urea]] (NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO from [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>)
   
   [[Amino acid catabolism]] results in waste ammonia. All animals need a way to excrete this product. Most aquatic organisms, or [[metabolic waste|ammonotelic]] organisms, excrete ammonia without converting it. Organisms that cannot easily and safely remove [[nitrogen]] as ammonia convert it to a less toxic substance, such as urea, via the urea cycle, which occurs mainly in the [[liver]]. Urea produced by the liver is then released into the [[circulatory system|bloodstream]], where it travels to the [[kidney|kidneys]] and is ultimately excreted in [[urine]]. The urea cycle is essential to these organisms, because if the nitrogen or ammonia is not eliminated from the [[organism]] it can be very detrimental.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea_cycle]
