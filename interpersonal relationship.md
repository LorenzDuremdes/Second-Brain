1. is it possible to know someone better than themselves? + example
	1. yes e.g. a [[human]] being knows/is capable of knowing how a monkey functions (e.g. behavior) more than the monkey itself is
2. steady states tend to be stable when they have a lower level of influence and a lower level of inertia^[The science of [[trust]]: emotional attunement for couples, p. 466]

# improvements
1. using skills (e.g. effective [[communication]]) to attract girls (fishing analogy)
	1. You're just selecting for the easiest wins. It's like telling guys to only go fishing with their biggest, loudest lure and then saying "If they're gonna bite, they're gonna bite." Yes, you will periodically catch fish and then apparently leap to the conclusion that it's not helpful to carry multiple kinds of lures to match different fish and fishing conditions.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/t1cxou/comment/hyhk3ng/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3] or any type of relationship
2. **why is it that most of the [[time]], the people that give the best [[dating]] advice are always single?**
	1. maybe they’re single because they don’t date just anyone and have high standards 🤷🏼‍♀️ just because you’re not actively in a relationship doesn’t mean you lose all concept of them^[https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tq3h44/comment/i2ew37f/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
		1. this is my take, too. If you’re brave enough to choose being single over a bad relationship, you’re likely to have your priorities straight - and thus give [[good]] advice

## complimenting
1. possibly improve the following^[https://www.instagram.com/p/CakjchqPsL4/]:

	"I really appreciate that you are so thoughtful of others."
	1. add an example: "...like last week when you..."

# [[psychology]]
1. people who cannot connect through work, friendships, or [[family]] usually find other ways of bonding, as through illnesses, lawsuits, or [[family]] feud^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 140]

# [[microsociology]]
1. the most natural way for [[human]] beings to calm themselves when they are upset is by clinging to another person^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 125]
2. adversity → interpersonal relationships^[The [[Happiness]] Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 149]
	1. adversity can strenghten (some) interpersonal relationships e.g. more appreciation or filtering out those who do not care as much

## dynamics
1. 69% of relationship problems are 'perpetual'^[https://www.instagram.com/p/CVLL4_rD3MF/]^[https://www.gottman.com/blog/managing-conflict-solvable-vs-perpetual-problems/]
	1. what matters is not solving perpetual problems, but rather the affect with which they are discussed.
2. are relationships hard work? + why^[https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/cl3oih/people_who_say_relationships_are_hard_work_are_in/]
	1. yes e.g. being vulnerable or willing to change

		most people are being extremely flippants these days → once it gets hard, they just quit

		1. bad [[communication]] skills can make things unnecessarily difficult^[https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/jd50dx/comment/g95hgau/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
	2. **other**
		1. [Some people are willing to leave a relationship at even the slightest inconvenience](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/roowr1/comment/hpzu3c2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
		2. [LPT: Stop looking for "the one", that's a made-up concept to sell romantic novels & movies. A real relationship needs work, commitment, compromise, understanding & willingness to have a two-way trade on every level & meet you halfway.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/src0ro/lpt_stop_looking_for_the_one_thats_a_madeup/)
		3. [There's a lot of work to be done in becoming a decent [[human]] being: developing integrity, [[empathy]], kindness, [[communication]] skills, expectation management skills, [[confidence]], courage, and respect for other people's autonomy. You have to learn what you want and need, how to talk openly to other people, how to be vulnerable, how not to be controlling or manipulative, how not to be selfish, how to choose compatible partners., [[Franklin Veaux]]](https://qr.ae/pGjSGe)

# [[emotion]]
1. the face is showing 50% [[happiness]] and [[anger]] (neutral)^[https://youtu.be/5n6lDNacfk0?t=360, Alok Kanojia]

# [[sociology]]
1. why is saying "we need to teach young people to become independent" somewhat wrong?^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 397]
	1. because we need to teach people to become *inter*dependent
