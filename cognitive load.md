	1. [[knowledge]] acquisition rate; learning [[speed]]
2. blinking → cognitive load
	1. blinking more might indicate higher cognitive load
		1. We blink less often when viewing nature than when looking at urban settings, indicating that nature imposes a less burdensome cognitive load.^[The Extended Mind: The Power of Thinking Outside the Brain, p. 99]
	2. blinking more during higher cognitive load might be a reflection of the [[brain]]'s attempt to manage the high cognitive load by briefly disengaging from the task, allowing for momentary mental breaks. Blinking temporarily interrupts visual input, which may allow the brain to momentarily disengage from the task at hand and refresh its resources^[GPT-4]
		1. at hand > probably meant semi-literally (lower probability historically (e.g. conscious calculations > modern?)
			1. while blinking doesn't directly reduce cognitive load in these tasks (i.e. mental tasks e.g. mental calculation), it may provide a brief moment of respite (i.e. mitigate the effects of _continuous_ cognitive effort) that allows the brain to reset or recalibrate its attentional resources.^[GPT-4]

# reducing cognitive load
1. [[Kolmogorov complexity]]
	1. [[Kolmogorov complexity]] and cognitive load are related in the sense that both concepts deal with the complexity of [[information]] and how it affects learning and understanding. While they originate from different fields, they can be connected in the context of [[human]] learning and [[information]] processing.
	   
	   The relationship between [[Kolmogorov complexity]] and cognitive load can be seen in how reducing the complexity of [[information]] can help to minimize cognitive load and facilitate learning. When [[information]] is presented in a simplified and structured manner, it can reduce the mental effort required to understand and retain the material, leading to more efficient learning.
	   
	   By minimizing the [[Kolmogorov complexity]] of the [[information]] being learned (i.e., simplifying and organizing the material), learners can reduce cognitive load and improve their ability to process, understand, and retain the [[information]]. This can be achieved through strategies such as breaking down complex concepts into simpler parts, using analogies and metaphors, creating mental models, and identifying patterns and relationships within the material.
	   
	   In summary, [[Kolmogorov complexity]] and cognitive load are related in the context of [[human]] learning, with a lower complexity of [[information]] often leading to reduced cognitive load and improved learning efficiency.^[GPT-4]
