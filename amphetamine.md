1. how do amphetamines enhance endurance performance (body [[temperature]])?
	1. Therefore, we conclude that amphetamine may mask or delay fatigue by slowing down exercise‐induced [[core body temperature]] growth by increasing [[thermoregulation|heat dissipation]].^[[Amphetamine enhances endurance by increasing heat dissipation](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5027360/)]
	2. One reason why amphetamines are so good, albeit illegal, for enhancing endurance performance is that they appear to remove the brain’s inhibition from overheating, allowing an athlete to continue beyond 40 °C. Great for performance, but it has also led to [[heat stroke]] deaths during competition. In 2009, a Kentucky high school football coach was tried for murder when one of his players collapsed and died in a practice in extreme [[heat]]. The coach was acquitted, and it was revealed that the player was taking prescribed amphetamines to treat ADHD^[The Sports Gene: Inside the Science of Extraordinary Athletic Performance, p. 342]
