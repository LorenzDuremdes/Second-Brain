1. The "old" RNI Films 4 is just a preset-based solution, i.e. they look good too but they just preset the channel curves and sliders to emulate film stocks.
   
   And the "new" RNI Films 5 is profile-based. Its looks can't be replicated with LR adjustments, especially visible for Technicolor and Aerochrome profiles. You can use them from the Presets panel but those presets are just wrappers for profiles and do not touch any of the sliders.
   
   Overall, the RNI profiles seem a bit more sophisticated than LUTs: they recover highlight data from RAW, de-clip blown highlights and do some other smart tricks that LUTs cannot do.^[https://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/4627707]
1. One thing I like about RNI (never used VSCO) is that you can emulate films that haven't been available for decades, even as far back as the 1940s.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/13ok1nm/emulating_film/]
