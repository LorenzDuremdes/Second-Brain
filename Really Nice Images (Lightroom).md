   RNI All Films 5 incorporates real film colour profiles. This enables really sophisticated and precise colour transformations which are far beyond what's been possible with Lightroom adjustments alone.
   
   Unlike typical LUT packages, RNI All Films 5 not only transforms colours but also achieves more natural film-like tonal response by using otherwise hidden data from your RAW files.
   
   With RNI All Films 5 your highlights will never clip, no matter how far you push them.
1. The "old" RNI Films 4 is just a preset-based solution, i.e. they look good too but they just preset the channel curves and sliders to emulate film stocks.
   
   And the "new" RNI Films 5 is profile-based. Its looks can't be replicated with LR adjustments, especially visible for Technicolor and Aerochrome profiles. You can use them from the Presets panel but those presets are just wrappers for profiles and do not touch any of the sliders.
   
   Overall, the RNI profiles seem a bit more sophisticated than LUTs: they recover highlight data from RAW, de-clip blown highlights and do some other smart tricks that LUTs cannot do.^[https://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/4627707]
2. One thing I like about RNI (never used VSCO) is that you can emulate films that haven't been available for decades, even as far back as the 1940s.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/13ok1nm/emulating_film/]
3. The latest RNI product (all films 5) is insanely good: https://reallyniceimages.com/products/rni-all-films-5-pro-for-adobe-lightroom.html
   
   Very good colors, the highlights roll-off without clipping like in real film, and generally they took the color harmony one step further: the colors feel special and somehow right. Even the Fujifilm simulations feel better and more accurate than what Fuji gets built into their X-series cameras.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/dkp34y/what_film_simulation_presets_do_you_use/]

   $192 is a lot of money but RNI is that good. I never wanted any other presets or profiles since upgrading to RNI v.5 for Lr.

   I'm using All Films 5 for C1 for about a week, and at the risk of mirroring others: RNI is a rare case when presets/profiles are worth the premium.
   
   It's like Leica or Porsche of profiles: you can go hating it or ranting about the price but only until you finally buy it.
