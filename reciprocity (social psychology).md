# sociology
1. social status → reciprocity
	1. those with a higher social status are less likely to reciprocate? e.g. due to less punishment e.g. some attractive girls
	2. they also can become used to it e.g. streamers getting donations
2. when a woman allows a man to buy her drinks, she is immediately judged (by both men and women) as more sexually available to him^[Influence, New and Expanded: The [[psychology]] of [[persuasion]], p. 8]
	1. e.g. sex/attention as reciprocation

# [[psychology]]
1. disliking → reciprocity^[Influence, New and Expanded: The Psychology of [[persuasion]], p. 8]
	1. disliking a person might not affect reciprocity as much e.g. sales person
	2. A more interesting finding was that the relationship between liking and compliance was completely wiped out in the condition under which subjects had been given a Coke by Joe. For those who owed him a favor, it made no difference whether they liked him or not; they felt a sense of obligation to repay him, and they did. The subjects who indicated they disliked Joe bought just as many of his tickets as did those who indicated they liked him. The rule of reciprocation was so strong it simply overwhelmed the influence of a factor—liking for the requester—that normally affects the decision to comply.
2. most people don't feel comfortable holding an obligation (reciprocity)^[Influence, New and Expanded: The Psychology of [[persuasion]], p. 8]
	1. one of the reasons why those who feel in debt give a disproportionally larger reciprocation

# process
1. how can "reciprocity" cause "unequal exchanges"?
	1. e.g. a small initial favor can produce a sense of obligation to agree to a substantially larger return favor^[Influence, New and Expanded: The Psychology of [[persuasion]], p. 8]
2. how does asking to lend "€20" followed by dropping it to "€10" be (unconsciously) seen as "reciprocity"?^[Influence, New and Expanded: The Psychology of [[persuasion]], p. 8]
	1. you are **dropping** it with €10, so the other feels the need to reciprocate
		1. "...We were reluctant to send him away with nothing."

# application
1. improve the following (reciprocity):
	1. “No big deal.” “Don’t think a thing about it.” “I would have done it for anybody.” → “Listen, if our positions were ever reversed, I know you’d do the same for me.”^[Influence, New and Expanded: The Psychology of [[persuasion]], p. 8]
2. should you do "uninvited favors"? + why
	1. yes e.g. to create a (feeling of) [[guilt|debt]]^[Influence, New and Expanded: The Psychology of [[persuasion]], p. 8]

# deweaponizing
1. Robert Cialdini's approach to deweaponizing "reciprocation ([[persuasion]])"^[Influence, New and Expanded: The Psychology of [[persuasion]], p. 8]
	1. he simply takes the "gift" and moves on

# myself
1. do you personally get affected a lot by "reciprocation" from other people? + why
	1. no, because I usually just care about myself → I reciprocate when it's advantageous for myself (psychopathic)

# [[construal level theory]]
1. construal level theory → reciprocation
	1. the lower the construal level, the better (usually)
	2. despite the impressive force the rule of reciprocation commands, there is a set of conditions that magnifies that force even more: when the first gift is customized, and thereby personalized, to the recipient’s current needs or preferences^[Influence, New and Expanded: The Psychology of [[persuasion]], p. 8]
	3. other model to apply: [[self-determination theory]]
2. reciprocity → social construal level
	1. reciprocity tends to extend toward other members of a group^[Influence, New and Expanded: The Psychology of [[persuasion]], p. 8]
		1. Additional research shows that this kind of group-based reciprocity extends to mistreatment. If we are harmed by a member of another group and we can’t harm that person, we’re more likely to take our revenge by mistreating someone else of that group (Hugh-Jones, Ron, & Zultan, 2019)
