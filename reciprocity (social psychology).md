1. social status → reciprocity
	1. those with a higher social status are less likely to reciprocate? e.g. due to less punishment e.g. some attractive girls
	2. they also can become used to it e.g. streamers getting donations
2. disliking → reciprocity^[Influence, New and Expanded: The Psychology of Persuasion, p. 8]
	1. disliking a person might not affect reciprocity as much e.g. sales person
	2. A more interesting finding was that the relationship between liking and compliance was completely wiped out in the condition under which subjects had been given a Coke by Joe. For those who owed him a favor, it made no difference whether they liked him or not; they felt a sense of obligation to repay him, and they did. The subjects who indicated they disliked Joe bought just as many of his tickets as did those who indicated they liked him. The rule of reciprocation was so strong it simply overwhelmed the influence of a factor—liking for the requester—that normally affects the decision to comply.
3. improve the following (reciprocity):
	1. “No big deal.” “Don’t think a thing about it.” “I would have done it for anybody.” → “Listen, if our positions were ever reversed, I know you’d do the same for me.”^[Influence, New and Expanded: The Psychology of Persuasion, p. 8]
