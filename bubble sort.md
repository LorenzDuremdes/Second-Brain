1. bubble sort → [[noise (spectral phenomenon)]]
	1. Its very inefficiency—moving items only one position at a [[time]]—makes it fairly robust against [[noise (spectral phenomenon)]]
		1. far more robust than faster algorithms like Mergesort, in which each comparison potentially moves an item a long way. Mergesort’s very efficiency makes it brittle. An early error in a Mergesort is like a fluke loss in the first round of a Single Elimination tournament, which can not only dash a favored team’s championship hopes but also permanently relegate them to the bottom half of the result.

In a Ladder tournament, on the other hand, as in a Bubble Sort, a fluke loss would only set a player back a single place in the standings.
