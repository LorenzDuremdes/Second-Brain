2. [Into The Void - Juliette Has A Gun](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Into-The-Void-39010.html)
	1. Takes you straight into the deep dark void. Once caught, there is no back. It's woody oriental and ambroxan gives it a special kick.
2. [Moon Dust - MiN New York](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/MiN-New-York/Moon-Dust-25382.html)
	1. Conceptually it’s so exquisitely niche. In so many ways it absolutely smells like one’s imagination of what the dusty surface of the moon smells like.

# how
1. where to apply perfume + why?
	1. behind the ears, at the nape of the neck, under the armpits and at the insides of wrists, elbows and knees, so that the pulse point will warm the perfume and release fragrance continuously^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfume]
