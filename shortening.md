1. any [[fat]] that is a solid at room temperature and is used to make crumbly [[pastry]] and other [[food]] products. The idea of shortening dates back to at least the 18th century, well before the invention of modern, shelf-stable vegetable shortening. In the earlier centuries, [[lard]] was the primary ingredient used to shorten [[dough]]. The reason it is called shortening is that it makes the resulting food crumbly, or to behave as if it had short fibers. Solid fat prevents cross-linking between [[gluten]] molecules. This cross-linking would give dough elasticity, so it could be stretched into longer pieces. In pastries such as cake, which should not be elastic, shortening is used to produce the desired texture.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortening]
