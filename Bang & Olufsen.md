# reviews
1. I had Sonos with the sub and 2 play ones, had a listen to BeoSound Stage and Beoplay A9. Sold my Sonos and bought Stage and A9. They are that good. You can’t qualify the sound based on frequency, Hz or watts. It’s their signature signal processing that does the magic. You have to listen to it for some time to understand that, it can’t be expressed in words or reviews. You can’t go wrong with B&O.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/audiophile/comments/j6s795/comment/gkvczjf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
