1. cold-inducible [[RNA-binding protein|RNA binding protein]] → [[sleep]]
	1. This is important as cortical [[temperature]] changes are heavily influenced by the sleep–wake transitions and entry into [[NREM sleep]] can then influence [[clock gene]] expression to drive further transcriptional changes. In mice without CIRP, [[sleep deprivation]] results in 50% less [[REM sleep]], illustrating the strength of this mechanism (Hoekstra et al., 2019). This also provides one possible mechanism that the [[brain]] may keep track of the [[time]] spent in [[NREM sleep]].^[[The Temperature Dependence of Sleep - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/)]
