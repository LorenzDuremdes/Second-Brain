1. magnetic resonance imaging vs. in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy
	1. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is an analytical technique that can be used to complement the more common magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the characterization of tissue. Both techniques typically acquire signal from [[hydrogen]] protons (other endogenous nuclei such as those of [[Carbon]], [[nitrogen]], and [[Phosphorus]] are also used), but MRI acquires signal primarily from protons which reside within [[water]] and [[fat]], which are approximately a thousand times more abundant than the molecules detected with MRS. As a result,Â **MRI often uses the larger available signal to produce very clean 2D images, whereas MRS very frequently only acquires signal from a single localized region, referred to as a "voxel".**^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy]
