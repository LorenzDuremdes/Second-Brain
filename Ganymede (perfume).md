1. Ganymede ([[perfume]]); A soulless creation, a wreckage adrift in space, going nowhere, stuck in the vast void. This [[perfume]] is art. You have never smelled anything like this. It's plastic, it's rocks, its ozone, it's ethereal. You cannot describe it to someone that has never smelled it before. 
   
   The immortelle in this is intoxicatingly beautiful. It is weird in a good sense. The mix between the minerals and the immortelle gives this a plasticky vibe if you don't give it much attention.^[https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Ganymede-54720.html]
2. Ganymede by Quentin Bisch is a masterpiece of unrivaled sophistication, elegance, and innovation done to otherworldly levels. Its scent is a dynamic interaction with how each of the notes blends and joins forces together to create a scent that smells like nothing that could be sourced from this planet. For example, the mandarin and osmanthus have been refined and processed in such a way so that only their most ambient chemical constituents remain, no zesty or sharp facets, but only the gentle radiation of a pleasantly artificial fruity neon haze persists, complementing the aquatic and ozonic features of the violet leaf present. This sort of manipulation of fragrant materials is pervasive within the entire fragrance, using very advanced accord creation techniques that I have found to not be currently replicated elsewhere. The suede note for example is crucially framed by a precise combination of the other notes that impart a sanitized leather feel to the fragrance, a suede that smells like it has been synthesized and manufactured to cushion the seats of a luxurious high-tech hovercraft or spaceship. The usage of saffron in Ganymede is also unique, as it is not metallic or heady, but instead enhances the juiciness of the mandarin and osmanthus in a highly exotic and aromatic manner, exploiting a facet of saffron that has been largely unexplored in my experience. Additionally, signature to Ganymede are the mineral notes present which I assume partially come from the dry and salty qualities of the immortelle and some high quality synthetic component that together is more akin to an envisioned smell of an asteroid than anything earthly. The slight smokiness, earthiness and saltiness within the mineral notes coupled by the cold mentholated icy freshness that is present throughout the entire fragrance altogether strongly give the impression of outer space, or a frozen but aquatic alien mineralized moon, fulfilling exactly the artistic vision of the fragrance. Ganymede is a fragrance that is intensely futuristic, it smells like your typical fresh blue fragrance if it was made in the 2060s to an atmospheric extreme with meticulous refinement and style. It is gorgeous while remaining avant-garde. 100/10. Perfectly unisex and can be used for all seasons but spring seems to be the most fitting.
