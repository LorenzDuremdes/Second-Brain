1. Ganymede ([[perfume]]); A soulles creation, a wreckage adrift in space, going nowhere, stuck in the vast void. This perfumes is art. You have never smelled anything like this. Its plastic, its rocks, its ozone, its ethereal. You cannot describe it to someone that has never smelled it before. 
   
   The imortelle in this is intoxicatingly beautiful. It is weird in a good sense. The mix between the minerals and the imortelle gives this a plasticky vibe if you dont give it much attention.^[https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Ganymede-54720.html]
2. I’ve described it as “a [[perfume]] a robot would wear.”^[https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/wzv6uy/comment/im7dpof/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
