1. Ganymede ([[perfume]]); A soulless creation, a wreckage adrift in space, going nowhere, stuck in the vast void. This perfume is art. You have never smelled anything like this. It's plastic, it's rocks, its ozone, it's ethereal. You cannot describe it to someone that has never smelled it before. 
   
   The immortelle in this is intoxicatingly beautiful. It is weird in a good sense. The mix between the minerals and the immortelle gives this a plasticky vibe if you dont give it much attention.^[https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Ganymede-54720.html]
2. I’ve described it as “a [[perfume]] a robot would wear.”^[https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/wzv6uy/comment/im7dpof/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
