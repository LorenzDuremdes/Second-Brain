1. CLOCK (circadian locomotor output cycles kaput) [[gene]]; a [[gene]] encoding a basic helix-loop-helix-PAS [[transcription factor]] that is known to affect both the persistence and period of circadian rhythms^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLOCK]
2. CLOCK genes are expressed not only in CNS, but also peripherally, in the oral mucosa, skin and [[blood]] (how?)
	1. the co-expression of the CLOCK [[gene]] in the [[blood]], [[hippocampus]], and [[prefrontal cortex]] allow hypothesizing that its presence peripherally could be a good [[peripheral biomarker|biomarker]] of the [[gene expression]] in the [[human brain|brain]]

# [[circadian rhythm]]
1. nightshift work → CLOCK [[gene]]
	1. **hypo-methylation of the CLOCK [[gene]] promoter** among nightshift workers suggests that epigenetic changes might be a mechanism through which shift work influences circadian rhythms and potentially increases **cancer risk**^[GPT-4]^[[Nightshift work and genome-wide DNA methylation: Chronobiology International: Vol 32 , No 1 - Get Access (tandfonline.com)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/07420528.2014.956362) (2014)]^[[Biological correlates of altered circadian rhythms, autonomic functions and sleep problems in autism spectrum disorder | Annals of General Psychiatry | Full Text (biomedcentral.com)](https://annals-general-psychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12991-022-00390-6) (2022)]
		1. The altered circadian rhythms, rather than the direct effects of CLOCK [[DNA hypomethylation|gene hypo-methylation]], are posited as a potential pathway through which shift work might increase cancer risk.
