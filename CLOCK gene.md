1. CLOCK (circadian locomotor output cycles kaput) [[gene]]; a [[gene]] encoding a basic helix-loop-helix-PAS [[transcription factor]] that is known to affect both the persistence and period of circadian rhythms^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLOCK]
2. CLOCK genes are expressed not only in CNS, but also peripherally, in the oral mucosa, skin and [[blood]] (how?)
	1. the co-expression of the CLOCK [[gene]] in the [[blood]], [[hippocampus]], and [[prefrontal cortex]] allow hypothesizing that its presence peripherally could be a good [[peripheral biomarker|biomarker]] of the [[gene expression]] in the [[human brain|brain]]
