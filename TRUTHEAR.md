# NOVA
1. NOVA has slightly less bass gain than [[Harman curve|HARMAN IE 2019 curve]] and is close to the high-frequency amplitude response of HARMAN OE 2013 with high [[head-related transfer function|HRTF]] characteristics, which results in a warm, soft, clear and natural sound thanks to the brand-new overall system design of lowering the Q value.
   
   [[Frequency response]]: 8-40kHz (IEC61094, Free Field)^[[TRUTHEAR NOVA In-ear Monitor](https://truthear.com/products/nova)]
2. This is a hybrid set using dynamic and balanced armature drivers aiming to give you a great reproduction of the [[Harman target]] for a reasonable price.
   
   The bass is also predominantly focused under 200 Hz so sub-bass aficionados can rejoice with this ~10.5 dB bass shelf that results in a small night club pumping inside your head. It's best to consider the dynamic response of the NOVA to be more akin to a sub-woofer thus, but a really good one if you can handle the volume.
   
   The Truthear NOVA is also somewhat of a market shaker in the sense that there isn't much in this price range that offers a similar sound presentation and does it well. Seeing as how the higher frequencies are the hardest to get right—there are IEMs which cost multiple thousands of dollars that do a terrible job here—I am amazed at how good the NOVA sounds here. If you are a fan of orchestral music, especially with strings and piano keys, the NOVA is easily worth the price of admission. It bests several more expensive sets here, and that's not the only place it punches above its weight either.^[[Truthear NOVA In-Ear Monitors Review - Harman Fans Rejoice! | TechPowerUp](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/truthear-nova-in-ear-monitors/)]
