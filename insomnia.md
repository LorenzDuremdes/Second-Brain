1. how many people report never to have experienced insomnia?
	1. ~5%

# [[hyperarousal]]
1. Moreover, the frequent arousals associated with [[sleep disorder|sleep disorders]] can lead to [[tachycardia]] or [[bradycardia]], followed by increased [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] and [[baroreceptor]] tone that may impair the [[autonomic nervous system|ANS]].^[[ Cardiovascular variability after arousal from sleep: time-varying spectral analysis. | Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Cardiovascular-variability-after-arousal-from-Blasi-Jo/1a7ac49489aa505772a5b39f3830c546f191f391)]^[[ Sympathetic neural responses to 24-hour sleep deprivation in humans: sex differences. | Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Sympathetic-neural-responses-to-24-hour-sleep-in-Carter-Durocher/3aaa6879469e3190c9cfedc6a8cc2b7ece40da15)] Indeed, a cardiovascular study demonstrated the connection between severe [[sleep deprivation]] and sympathovagal imbalance.^[[Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in insomnia patients with objective short sleep duration | Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Cardiovascular-autonomic-dysfunction-in-insomnia-Jarrin-Ivers/bf1dfb34002819fb422f76d90e69c9246ecfd66e)] That study found that patients with a [[total sleep time|sleep duration]] of less than 6 hours have elevated mean [[heart rate variability|heart-rate variability]] metrics and reduced [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] activities compared with the normal population. Other studies have also provided evidence of autonomic dysfunction in the form of [[hyperarousal]], which is the “[[tired but wired]]” condition that prevents patients from falling asleep despite being exhausted.

# [[physiology]]
1. in both humans and other mammals, direct skin warming can shorten [[sleep onset latency|sleep-latency]] and promote [[NREM sleep]]
   
   Paradoxically, this warmth might also induce [[vasodilation]] and body cooling. In this way, warmth seeking and nesting behaviour might enhance the circadian cycle by activating specific circuits that link NREM initiation to body cooling. We suggest that these circuits explain why NREM onset is most likely when core [[temperature]] is at its steepest rate of decline and why transitions to NREM are accompanied by a decrease in [[brain]] [[temperature]].
   
   In all mammals, [[sleep]] appears to be indispensable and coincides with a conserved circadian [[temperature]] rhythm. When our core and [[brain]] temperatures are in rapid decline we are most likely to choose to [[sleep]], and if we dissociate from this cycle of body cooling we experience insomnia ([Hayward, 1968](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B56); [Campbell and Broughton, 1994](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B18); [Lack et al., 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B75)).^[[The Temperature Dependence of Sleep - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/)]
