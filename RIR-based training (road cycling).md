|     Low     | 1st phase of stable performance |  15–20% of maximal duration until clear fatigue | Maintaining exercise performance and accelerated recovery |   |
|   Moderate  | 2nd phase of stable performance |  20–60% of maximal duration until clear fatigue |              Maintaining exercise performance             |   |
| Sub-maximal |   Phase of compensated fatigue  |  60–75% of maximal duration until clear fatigue |    Stabilization and moderate increases in performance    |   |
