## My [[insomnia]] treatment success story
1. I have had [[insomnia]] for as long as I can remember. Even going to a sleepover party at a friend's house when I was 12 or 13, I would be the very last one awake. My friends would fall asleep long before I did, and then of course in the morning I was very tired.
   
   I had tried everything for [[insomnia]]. I gave a very brief trial to [[somnifacient|sleep medications]] like Ambien and Lunesta, but they had no effect on me. I was glad not to have a [[somnifacient|sleep medication]] addiction, but frustrated that nothing helped.
   
   Things came to a breaking point a few months ago. I was sleeping only 4 hours a night during the week, and then 10 hours on weekends. Every work night I couldn't [[sleep]]. My boyfriend told me "it was all in my head" (which I knew) but I couldn't change it. I took magnesium and other supplements. My [[sleep]] routines were crazy, and if anything was messed up or out of place, my [[anxiety]] would go through the roof. I used a blindfold. I used earplugs AND headphones for white noise. Specific pajamas. I tried sleeping on the couch, basement, different beds. I had to start on my right side, switch to my left, and go back to the right. If I didn't [[sleep]] I had to go back to the left, then the right. If I still couldn't [[sleep]], I'd lie on my stomach until I felt sleepy then back to my right side.
   
   I was frustrated. Depressed. Dead tired. I thought there was something seriously medically wrong with me. I saw a new doctor, who recommended an online CBT program for [[sleep]]. Seriously? CBT for [[sleep]]? And why is it so expensive? I asked my boyfriend if I should do it, and his answer was a wholehearted yes. I was furious with him. Ha ha.
   
   I knew about [[sleep]] restriction for years but never did it because I knew how awful it would be. Just knowing that I would have to do this I broke down crying multiple times in the first week, and that was just the observation week! I had an incredible amount of [[anxiety]] about restricting my [[sleep]]. I. did. not. want. to. do. it. I was too tired to restrict my [[sleep]] more. Don't make me!
   But I did it anyway. I moved my bedtime back 3 hours. I stopped sleeping in on weekends. And I stopped reading in bed -- one of my favorite things to do. And the madness began. I would go to bed, not [[sleep]], get up and go to the couch, and read. Repeat this 2-3 times. I'd finally fall asleep sometime around 1-2 a.m. I would wake up at 5 a.m. and be unable to go back to [[sleep]].
   
   It was hell.
   
   But I kept at it. I had tried everything else, so I figured what did I have to lose this [[time]]? I tried to view my later bedtime as "spare [[time]]" and enjoyed spending it with my boyfriend. I tried to see getting out of bed if I couldn't [[sleep]] as more free [[time]] to read. I was learning things from the online CBT program, and my boyfriend was very supportive. I logged my [[sleep]] each night.
   
   Finally things began to change. In the third week, I finally stopped waking up at 5 a.m. and slept almost to my alarm. I started getting 5.5 hours of [[sleep]] every night, but still felt incredibly tired. The next week, I began getting 6-6.5 hours of [[sleep]] and sometimes even 7. I actually began to feel refreshed by [[sleep]]!
   
   Then the IMPOSSIBLE happened. I would lie down, and almost immediately fall to [[sleep]]. This had NEVER happened in my entire life. It had always taken me at least 90 minutes to fall asleep.
   
   My CBT program had said that "good sleepers don't do anything to go to [[sleep]]." It was happening! I also learned that I do not need 8 hours of [[sleep]] and trying to force that to happen just made my [[insomnia]] and [[anxiety]] worse. I feel great on 6.5-7 hours of [[sleep]]. Anything less than 6 and I feel tired. After years of getting 4-5 hours of [[sleep]] on most nights this is such a blessing. I am so enjoying the fact that I can lie down and go straight to [[sleep]] and [[sleep]] through the night.
   
   I did have a setback while on vacation recently. Having to [[sleep]] in a new environment and a different bed was difficult, and I didn't [[sleep]] much the first night. But I knew that I would begin sleeping well soon. By the third night, I was sleeping much better and was able to enjoy the rest of the vacation.
   
   The most important learnings I took away from [[insomnia]] CBT:
   - [[Sleep]] restriction is #1 treatment for [[insomnia]].
   - If you can't [[sleep]] within 20 minutes, simply get up and enjoy reading or another low-key activity.
   - Use the bed for [[sleep]] and sex only. No reading, no cell phones, no TV, no Reddit.
   - Consistent wake-up [[time]]. No more sleeping in ever.
   - Don't go to bed early, and don't go to bed until sleepy, even if it's past your "bedtime."
   - No naps.
   - Resetting your biological clock takes [[time]]. Stick with it.
   - Good sleepers don't do anything to [[sleep]].
   - I don't need 8 hours of [[sleep]]. Trying to force myself to [[sleep]] more doesn't work.

TL;DR: I used an online [[sleep]] CBT program, and no longer struggle with [[insomnia]] on a daily basis.
