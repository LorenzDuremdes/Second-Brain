1. how do you know if a power meter is accurate (personally)?
	1. your daily caloric needs are partially based on calories burned:
	   - a power meter overestimating power would mean you would gain [[fat]]
	   - a power meter underestimating power would mean you would lose [[fat]], feel lethargic, etc.
	   - or it would result in a highly deviating/strange RMR (e.g. >2300 at a ~60.5 kg bodyweight despite lots of muscle or <1900 (which wouldn't make sense _with_ a lot of muscle))
	   2. this [[microcycle]] you did almost solely [[Zwift]]/[[ergometer]] and you lose 0.2 kg (cutting was planned)
