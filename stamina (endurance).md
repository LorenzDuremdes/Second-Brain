1. why not just do a higher intensity but with a longer total time vs. lower intensity with higher torque (stamina / [[muscular endurance]])?
	1. perhaps the former is more fatiguing (CNS) + can get more easily to [[task failure]]
		1. â—‡theoretically if the [[task failure]] % is kept the same, it might give the same effects on stamina
