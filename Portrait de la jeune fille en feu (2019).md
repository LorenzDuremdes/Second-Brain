(Portrait of a Lady on Fire)

1. what kind of [[philosophy]] does the "_Portrait de la jeune fille en feu (2019)_" perhaps suggest?
	1. [[extended mind]] → the video mentions how the portrait at the end also 'stares' back to Marianne (e.g. page 28 of the book of Héloïse) and how Marianne and Héloïse are still connected to each other in various ways^[[How 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire' Reveals Its Secrets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq09zsqgFOc), [Spikima Movies](https://www.youtube.com/@SpikimaMovies)]
		1. Because different people may value the passage of time differently, [[ephemerality]] may be a relative, perceptual concept: "In brief, **what is short-lived may not be the object itself, but the attention we afford it**".^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemerality] → they both (especially Héloïse) afforded a lot and long-lasting attention to it even after Marianne physically left
		2. _“There is nothing sacred about skull and skin.”_ ―The Extended Mind, p. 63
		3. “_Reading good books is like engaging in conversation with the most cultivated minds of past centuries who had composed them, or rather, taking part in a well-conducted dialogue in which such minds reveal to us only the best of their thoughts_.” ―René Descartes

	1. >I love the references to Albert Camus throughout, specifically the Myth of Sisyphus. Given the absurdity of life (arranged marriage) why doesn’t Heloise kill herself (like her sister)? She finds meaning through relationships and shared experiences. Both [[women]] are forced to find meaning and purpose in their lives. The [[film]] also explores themes of alienation and loneliness, which are central to Camus' philosophy. The film's focus on the beauty of the natural world and the importance of [[human]] connection can also be linked to **Camus' belief in the power of art to bring people together and create meaning in an otherwise meaningless universe.**
		1. For The New Yorker, writer Rachel Syme said Portrait of a Lady on Fire thoroughly examines "the entanglements between artistic creation and burgeoning love, between memory and ambition and freedom. The film is about the erotic, electric connection between women when they find their desire for creative experience fulfilled in each other, but it is equally about the powers of art to validate, preserve, and console after a romance is over".^[https://web.archive.org/web/20211129221854/https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-is-more-than-a-manifesto-on-the-female-gaze]
	2. >I found a few analogs to Nietzsche's philosophy from the film as well. One of Nietzsche's biggest projects was understanding how we can discover meaning for ourselves through art and the creation of one's own values. When art is realized in life, life is affirmed in art. Beautiful film with a number of really strong themes communicated directly through the visuals

	3. “Ending things at the peak allows the memory to live on, unsullied by the trials that [[time]] inevitably brings.” – Unknown
	4. “It’s better to end it with a smile than to drag it out and lose the warmth of what was.” – Unknown

	1. Noémie Merlant: "We created everything during the shooting ... And so the gazes were real (laughs)" (9:00)
2. It is really poignant how the farewell scene coincided with Adèle's last day shooting. Céline says Néomie's face was drained of blood, white as a sheet, because she was so emotional. The parting wasn't just between the characters but between the actresses too.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/PortraitofaLadyonFire/comments/j9ehzl/watching_again_with_commentary_on_comments_by/]
