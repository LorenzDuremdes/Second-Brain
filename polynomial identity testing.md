1. [[polynomial]] identity testing; the problem of efficiently determining whether two multivariate polynomials are identical^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_identity_testing]
2. if you have two polynomial expressions, such as $$2x^3+13x^2+22x+8$$ and $$(2x+1)·(x+2)·(x+4)$$, working out whether those expressions are in fact the same function—by doing all the multiplication, then comparing the results—can be incredibly [[time]]-consuming, especially as the number of variables increases^[Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions, p. 200]
	1. Here again randomness offers a way forward: just generate some random xs and plug them in. If the two expressions are not the same, it would be a big coincidence if they gave the same answer for some randomly generated input. And an even bigger coincidence if they also gave identical answers for a second random input. And a bigger coincidence still if they did it for three random inputs in a row.
