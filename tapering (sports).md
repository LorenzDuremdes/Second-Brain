## [[sports science (cycling)]]
1. how much does a taper increase performance?
	1. results for overall effects on TT performance showed a significant improvement between pre- and post-tapering (SMD, −0.45; 95% CI, −0.68 to −0.23; P < 0.05; Fig 2)
	   
	   Significant improvement was also observed in experimental groups compared with control groups (SMD, −0.73; 95% CI, −1.25 to −0.21; P < 0.05; Fig 3), with a low level of heterogeneity (I2 = 31%, P > 0.1). Begg and Egger tests results showed no significant [[publication bias]] in the experimental group for TT (P > 0.1).
	   
	   The results showed that a tapering strategy with a reduction in training volume of **41–60% that maintained training intensity and frequency, lasted ≤ 21 days**, and used progressive or step tapering could significantly improve the TT of endurance athletes (P < 0.05; Table 2)^[[Effects of tapering on performance in endurance athletes: A systematic review and meta-analysis - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10171681/)]
		1. makes sense when looking at the research on how to maintain endurance performance
2. duration = ≤21 days
	1. the results of this meta-analysis showed that endurance athletes achieved the largest effect size during 8–14 days of taper (SMD, −1.47; 95% CI, −2.75 to −0.19; _P_ < 0.05)
	   
	   durations of ≤ 7 and 15–21 days are also effective in improving sports performance^[[Effects of tapering on performance in endurance athletes: A systematic review and meta-analysis - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10171681/)]
	2. fast- vs slow-decay tapering (sports)
		1. Wilson and Wilson suggested that the choice of the two exponential-taper types or patterns should be combined with taper duration, with **preference given to the fast-decay pattern if taper duration is short and to the slow-decay pattern in cases of longer taper duration**
3. how can a taper be further improved?
	1. For further exploration the training features of overload period preceding the taper, we further tracked the original research studies and found that the mean training intensity of pre-taper overload training remained at 85–95% of maximum [[heart rate]] (HRmax), an **increase of 23–26% over the mean training intensity of normal training**. This was consistent with the findings of Thomas et al.  that **an increase in pre-taper training load of approximately 20–30% was effective in improving post-taper performance**. Another study found that pre-taper overload training produced higher training-induced adaptations and facilitated supercompensation. The studies by Hellard et al. and Le Meur et al. showed that improvements in V˙O2max and [[cardiac output|heart pumping function]] of athletes who underwent overload training pre-taper were significantly higher than those of athletes who underwent conventional tapering only.^[[Effects of tapering on performance in endurance athletes: A systematic review and meta-analysis - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10171681/)]
	   
	   although further future exploration of the interactions between changes in training frequency, intensity, and volume remains necessary, the above results showed that **training frequency maintenance during tapering could effectively promote improvement in sports performance**, especially in endurance events that are highly dependent on technology and high technical proficiency
4. short vs. long tapering (sports) preference + why
	1. short in conjunction with Dr. Andrew Coggan's training philosophy ([Overload and Overtraining (sdsu.edu)](https://coachsci.sdsu.edu/csa/vol13/rushall7.htm))^[[Overload and Overtraining (timetriallingforum.co.uk)](https://www.timetriallingforum.co.uk/index.php?/topic/136241-recovery-weekadaption/&do=findComment&comment=1866699)]

## [[physiology]]
1. muscle fiber type dominance → tapering (sports)
	1. ‘Dani’s a fast-twitch type 2 rider, Wendy much more slow-twitch. Dani’s always going to see a much bigger rebound during the taper,’ I was told. In other words, the more sprint-orientated a rider, the more they can expect to gain during the last days.^[Faster - The Obsession, Science and Luck Behind the World's Fastest Cyclists (by Michael Hutchinson), p. 96]
2. [[men]] vs. [[women]] → tapering (sports) length
	1. A curiosity of the taper is that it affects [[men]] and [[women]] differently. [[Women]] lose form much more quickly when they stop training – quite why no one seems to know. I’ve heard suggestions ranging from ‘smaller quantities of free [[testosterone]]’, to the idea that [[men]] are physiologically (and not, I was told in no uncertain terms, psychologically) able to train harder, so it takes them longer to recover, during which [[time]] they keep improving. Whatever the reason, the upshot of it is that [[women]] athletes have a shorter taper period.^[Faster - The Obsession, Science and Luck Behind the World's Fastest Cyclists (by Michael Hutchinson), p. 96]
