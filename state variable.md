1. state variable; one of the set of variables that are used to describe the mathematical "state" of a dynamical system
2. Intuitively, the state of a system describes enough about the system to determine its future behaviour in the absence of any external forces affecting the system.
3. state variable â†’ [[dimension]]
	1. usually 4th dimension
		1. can be above if the variables can predict alternative future behaviors?
