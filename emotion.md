1. 3 steps to expressing feelings rather than suppressing them^[The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook, 375]:
	1. identify
	2. express
	3. communicate
		1. why "identify"? because people who have suppressed their emotions might not even be able to identify what they are [[feeling]]

			2. stage 2 probably still possible → more right hemispherical
2. do people experience the 7 basic emotions in the same way? + why
	1. yes e.g. same body [[language]] (e.g. facial expressions)^[The science of [[trust]]: emotional attunement for couples, p. 201]

	1. no, our emotions assign value to experiences and thus are the foundation of reason^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 80]
