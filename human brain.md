# specialization
1. the most important job of the [[brain]] is to ensure our survival, even under the most miserable conditions. Everything else is secondary.^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 70]
	1. what about propagation of genes?
2. [[homeostasis]] → [[brain]] + example
	1. the [[brain]] tries to maintain [[homeostasis]] e.g. reducing [[anger]] or [[happiness]]
		1. exceptions include [[depression]], mania, etc.
		2. certain people are more likely to gravitate toward particular node(s)? e.g. [[depression]]
	2. **related**
		1. [[regression toward the mean]]

# [[ontogenesis]]
1. the [[human]] [[brain]] is built from bottom up ([[ontogenesis]])

# [[decussation]]
1. what could have caused the [[decussation]] of the [[human]] [[brain]]?
	1. theorized to have arisen at a point in [[evolution]] when early vertebrates’ bodies twisted 180 degrees with respect to their heads; whereas the nerve cords of invertebrates such as lobsters and earthworms run on the “belly” side of the animal, vertebrates have their nerve cords along the spine instead^[Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of [[Human]] Decisions, p. 175–176]
		1. why? protective mechanisms (spine safer?)?

# hypotheses
1. does the [[human]] [[brain]] function more according to "[[packet switching]]" or "[[circuit switching]]"?
	1. both e.g. [[consciousness]] is more circuit while subconsciousness more packet?
