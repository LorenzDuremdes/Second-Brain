	   This systematic review and meta-analysis have shown improved performance after a warm-up 79% of the time. This review has also shown that there is **little evidence to suggest that warming-up is detrimental** to sports participants because many methodological issues exist within the studies that demonstrated such a change. Physical activity participants should therefore be encouraged to perform a period of aerobic exercise, followed by stretching, and ending with a period of **activity similar to the event** they are to perform before beginning any activity. These activities should focus on the body segments that will be used in the subsequent performance and should **not be too intense** in nature so as to fatigue the participant.
	   
	   The degree of improvement varied widely, from less than 1% through nearly 20% improvement.
	   
	   Although most of the warm-ups and criterion tasks evaluated showed an improvement in performance (79%), **17% showed a decrement**. When examining these in more detail, it was shown that many of **these warm-ups were not suited to the performance to be performed**. For example, 10-12 jumping jacks were performed before throwing, cycling, and basketball free throw performances. When compared with the best-practice theory of warm-up protocols, these warm-ups did not include aspects specific to the tasks to be performed, and completion of the warm-up was **not of a long enough duration for an increase in muscle temperature** to occur; thus, it would not be expected that in these circumstances that performances would improve.^[[Effects of Warming-up on Physical Performance: A Systematic Review With Meta-analysis](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2010/01000/effects_of_warming_up_on_physical_performance__a.21.aspx)]

1. warming-up → aerobic vs. anaerobic performance afterward
	1. Most warm-ups are trying to do relatively simple things. An easy spin to start stimulates [[fat]] burning, increases [[circulatory system|blood flow]], and [[vasodilation|dilates blood vessels]]. A build-up of intensity into a few harder efforts starts to stockpile enzymes and stimulate hormones. For an endurance athlete, part of the idea is to ease the transition into full-on effort. **Aerobic [[metabolism]] always takes a little time to catch up with the [[energy]] demands after a standing start, and in the meantime the job has to be done anaerobically**. If the warm-up can stimulate aerobic enzymes, it reduces the lag and preserves some of your anaerobic ability for later in the event. How hard you can finish a race might depend on the warm-up you did an hour before.^[Faster - The Obsession, Science and Luck Behind the World's Fastest Cyclists (by Michael Hutchinson), p. 97]
