1. warming-up → aerobic vs. anaerobic performance afterward
	1. Most warm-ups are trying to do relatively simple things. An easy spin to start stimulates [[fat]] burning, increases [[circulatory system|blood flow]], and [[vasodilation|dilates blood vessels]]. A build-up of intensity into a few harder efforts starts to stockpile enzymes and stimulate hormones. For an endurance athlete, part of the idea is to ease the transition into full-on effort. **Aerobic [[metabolism]] always takes a little time to catch up with the [[energy]] demands after a standing start, and in the meantime the job has to be done anaerobically**. If the warm-up can stimulate aerobic enzymes, it reduces the lag and preserves some of your anaerobic ability for later in the event. How hard you can finish a race might depend on the warm-up you did an hour before.^[Faster - The Obsession, Science and Luck Behind the World's Fastest Cyclists (by Michael Hutchinson), p. 97]
2. warming-up → [[viscosity]]
	1. a warming-up increases the [[viscosity]] and flexibility of muscles and joints^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 162]
