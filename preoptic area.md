1. the preoptic area (a region of the [[hypothalamus]]) is responsible for [[thermoregulation]] and receives nervous stimulation from [[thermoreceptor|thermoreceptors]] in the skin, [[mucous membrane|mucous membranes]], and [[hypothalamus]] itself^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preoptic_area]
2. preoptic [[neuron|neurons]] command [[efferent nerve fiber|descending pathways]] to switch off heat production in [[brown adipose tissue|brown adipocytes]], promote [[vasodilation]], and induce drinking^[[A Neuronal Hub Binding Sleep Initiation and Body Cooling in Response to a Warm External Stimulus - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6078908/)]

# [[sleep]]
1. about 60% of warm-sensitive neurons (WSN) also increased their activity during NREM ([Alam et al., 1995](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B3))^[[The Temperature Dependence of Sleep - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/)]
2. [[brain]] [[temperature]] → median preoptic [[hypothalamus]]
	1. At the first point of integration, the glutamatergic neurons conveying excessive warmth [[synapse]] at [[glutamate receptor|glutamatergic neurons]] in the [[median preoptic nucleus|MnPO]], whose output initiates cooling by promoting [[vasodilation]] and switching off [[brown adipose tissue|brown fat]] [[thermogenesis]] ([Morrison and Nakamura, 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B91))^[[The Temperature Dependence of Sleep - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/
	2. [[neuronal nitric oxide synthase|nitrergic]]-[[glutamate receptor|glutamatergic neurons]] in MnPO-[[medial preoptic nucleus|MPO]] induced both body cooling and [[NREM sleep]]^[[A Neuronal Hub Binding Sleep Initiation and Body Cooling in Response to a Warm External Stimulus - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6078908/)]
3. others have demonstrated that activating [[glutamate receptor|glutamatergic cells]] in [[median preoptic nucleus|MnPO]]-[[medial preoptic nucleus|MPO]] induces [[hypothermia]] and that [[GABA receptor|GABAergic neurons]] in the MnPO-MPO area do not [[homeostasis|regulate body temperature]]
   
   _not to be confused with:_ GABAergic cells recently defined in the lateral preoptic area that elicit hypothermia^[[A Neuronal Hub Binding Sleep Initiation and Body Cooling in Response to a Warm External Stimulus - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6078908/)]
