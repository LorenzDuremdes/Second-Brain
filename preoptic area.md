1. the preoptic area (a region of the [[hypothalamus]]) is responsible for [[thermoregulation]] and receives nervous stimulation from [[thermoreceptor|thermoreceptors]] in the skin, [[mucous membrane|mucous membranes]], and [[hypothalamus]] itself^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preoptic_area]
2. about 60% of warm-sensitive neurons (WSN) also increased their activity during NREM ([Alam et al., 1995](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B3))^[[The Temperature Dependence of Sleep - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/)]
3. [[brain]] [[temperature]] → median preoptic [[hypothalamus]]
	1. At the first point of integration, the glutamatergic neurons conveying excessive warmth [[synapse]] at [[glutamate receptor|glutamatergic neurons]] in the MnPO, whose output initiates cooling by promoting [[vasodilation]] and switching off [[brown adipose tissue|brown fat]] [[thermogenesis]] ([Morrison and Nakamura, 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B91))^[[The Temperature Dependence of Sleep - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/)]
