2. I’m one of those guys that trains twice a day and lifts (once 3x a week). The thing is, you always feel shit, no way around it. You’re always sore and hurting, somethings always bothering you. It doesn’t get any better because you learn how to train harder. You realise after some time tho, that your body can actually handle a lot, and it’s just your mind that wants to give up, most ppl are actually really capable of training that way, it just hurts like a mfer. But if you’re on roids from guys (they’re powerlifters tho) that I’ve met that are on it, apparently you just feel good all the time^[https://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/osu7nk/comment/h6r554x/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]
