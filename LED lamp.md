1. how is white light from LED [[lighting]] generally produced (~2024)?
	1. white light from [[lighting]] is generally produced by pairing a blue LED emitting primarily near 450 nm combined with a phosphor for down-conversion of some of the [[blue light]] to longer wavelengths, which then combine to form white light
	   
	   this is often considered “the next generation of illumination” as SSL technology dramatically reduces [[energy]] resource requirements.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_effects_of_high-energy_visible_light#Blue_LED_light]
