1. hypertonia; a term sometimes used synonymously with spasticity and rigidity in the literature surrounding damage to the [[central nervous system]], namely upper motor neuron lesions. Impaired ability of damaged [[motor neuron|motor neurons]] to regulate descending pathways gives rise to disordered spinal [[reflex|reflexes]], increased excitability of [[muscle spindle|muscle spindles]], and decreased synaptic inhibition. These consequences result in abnormally increased [[muscle tone]] of symptomatic muscles.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertonia]
