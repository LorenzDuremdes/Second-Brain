1. There is evidence that β-alanine supplementation can increase exercise and cognitive performance, for some sporting modalities, and exercises within a **0.5–10 min** time frame. β-alanine is converted within [[muscle]] cells into [[carnosine]], which acts as a buffer for the [[lactic acid]] produced during high-intensity exercises, and helps delay the onset of neuromuscular fatigue.
   
   Studies have found a range of **3.2–6.4 grams per day** of beta-alanine to be effective for enhancing exercise performance. To optimize carnosine stores, a chronic loading dose of 4–6 grams per day of beta-alanine divided into doses of 2 grams or less for a minimum of 2 weeks is suggested — this results in a 20%–30% increase in muscle carnosine stores, while a 40%–60% increase is observed after 4 weeks. A larger dose of 6 grams per day divided into 4 equal doses (1.5 grams each) is more advantageous.
   
   Although beta-alanine is commonly included in preworkout supplements, the **timing of ingestion does not influence its effectiveness**.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%92-Alanine]
2. Combining beta-alanine supplementation with [[creatine]] may enhance its effectiveness.^[https://examine.com/supplements/beta-alanine/]
3. β-alanine (minimum dosage for muscle carnosine) = To increase muscle carnosine, a larger dose of 6 g, divided into 4 equal doses would be more advantageous. Additionally, if supplementing with a non-time release version, consuming a total daily dose of 6 g would be important for augmenting muscle carnosine. Single large boluses of beta-alanine have been shown to induce paraesthesia (i.e. tingling), and have not been effective for performance outcomes likely due to strong paraesthesia, rapid changes in pH, higher excretion rates, and inability to effectively load the muscle contents. Combining beta-alanine consumption with a meal during beta-alanine loading has also been shown to be effective for further augmenting muscle carnosine levels^[[International society of sports nutrition position stand: Beta-Alanine (2015)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4501114/)]
4. β-alanine (short-term dosage) = 20 g of sustained-release β-alanine was administered during one week (7 days)
   
   Compared to placebo, the BA improved mean power (6.21%, 37.23 W; 95% CI: 3.98–70.48 W, _p_ = 0.046), distance travelled (2.16%, _p_ = 0.046) and total work (4.85%, _p_ = 0.046) without differences in cadence (_p_ = 0.506) or RPE. Lactate (_p_ = 0.036) and anion gap (_p_ = 0.047) were also higher in the BA group, without differences in pH or [[Bicarbonate]]. High daily and single doses were well tolerated. One-week high-dose β-alanine loading with a sustained-release powder blend can help attenuate 10′ TT performance losses of world tour cyclists due to intensive training.
   
   The BA group consumed a sustained-release β-ala powder blend (BETAFOR3MAX®, Martinez Nieto S.A., Cartagena, Spain) for 7 days, in 4 daily intakes just after meals (breakfast, lunch, snack and dinner), leaving at least 4 h between each.^[[One-Week High-Dose β-Alanine Loading Improves World Tour Cyclists’ Time-Trial Performance](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8401416/)]
