1. adaptive [[simulated annealing]]; a variant of [[simulated annealing]] (SA) [[algorithm]] in which the [[algorithm]] parameters that control temperature schedule and random step selection are automatically adjusted according to [[algorithm]] progress^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_simulated_annealing]
	1. e.g. step size or faster/slower temperature schedules
2. adaptive [[simulated annealing]]; connects the cooling schedule to the search progress^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing#Cooling_schedule]

# thermodynamic [[simulated annealing]]
1. thermodynamic [[simulated annealing]]; automatically adjusts the temperature at each step based on the [[energy]] difference between the two states
	1. ◇larger differences → smaller step sizes (e.g. in an exponentially weighted manner)
