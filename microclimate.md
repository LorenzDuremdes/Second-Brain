# [[sleep]]
1. can a higher ambient [[temperature]] replace microclimate (and not affect [[sleep]]) + why
	1. a key factor in using microclimates is that, at least in humans, it cannot be replaced by ambient warming at the same [[temperature]], perhaps because it disrupts the self-adjustment required over the course of the night ([Muzet et al., 1984](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B92); [Raymann et al., 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B107)).
2. We hypothesised that thermoregulatory circuits themselves might have an important role in facilitating [[sleep]]. This would also explain the propensity of either external or direct PO warming to induce [[NREM sleep]]. We again used activity-tagging, but this [[time]] labelled only those preoptic ensembles that received warm sensory information. Reactivation of these ‘warm-tagged’ neurons produced simultaneous NREM and body cooling ([Harding et al., 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B54)). These neurons expressed a mixture of cell type markers including the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), glutamate decarboxylase (GAD67), and nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1). When activity-tagging was repeated in NOS1-CRE mice, these also experienced simultaneous NREM and body cooling. However, when it was repeated in vGAT-CRE mice only NREM and a little body cooling was observed. As these NOS1 neurons express VGLUT2, our data suggest a distinct nitrergic-glutamatergic circuit for linking thermal sensory information to NREM-onset that may reside upstream of a [[GABAergic]] [[sleep]] ‘switch’ ([Harding et al., 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B54)). **In this circuitry, external warmth is a permissive state for NREM initiation. Without this sensory input NREM onset is inhibited. We think this is consistent with data showing that external warming promotes [[sleep]] in humans and animals, whilst also providing a possible mechanism for why mammals seek nesting sites: to produce microclimates of skin warmth that permit [[sleep]].** We don’t yet know if NOS1 neurons utilise nitric oxide (NO) in synaptic transmission. However, NO is implicated in modulating [[arousal]] in other areas of the [[brain]] ([Gerashchenko et al., 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B45); [Kalinchuk et al., 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B64); [Cespuglio et al., 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B21); [Morairty et al., 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B88); [Yu et al., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B156)).
   
   [[Thermoregulation]] is important for [[human]] [[sleep]]. **(A)** Humans use bedding to form warm microclimates during [[sleep]]. **These activate central hypothalamic mechanisms to induce [[sleep]] and peripheral [[vasodilation]].** **(B)** Distal-to-proximal gradient and core [[temperature]] decline predict [[sleep onset latency|sleep onset]] (adapted from [Krauchi et al., 2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B69)).^[[ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/)]
