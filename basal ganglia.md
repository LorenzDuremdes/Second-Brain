1. basal ganglia (specialization); associated with a variety of functions, including control of voluntary motor movements, procedural learning, habit learning, conditional learning,^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_ganglia#cite_note-1] eye movements, [[cognition]],^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_ganglia#cite_note-a1-2] and [[emotion]].^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_ganglia#cite_note-rapid-3]

# function
1. basal ganglia → [[acute stress response]]
	1. the former produces the "freeze response"^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 103]
2. in a seminal research paper published in 1999, University of Sheffield researchers brought together evidence from neuroscience and computer modeling to argue that selection is precisely the function of an ancient group of structures deep within the human brain called the basal ganglia^[The Hungry Brain (Stephan J. Guyenet, Ph.D.), p. 32]

# [[neurochemistry]]
1. [[dopamine]] → basal ganglia
	1. When dopamine levels in the striatum are increased—for example, by [[cocaine]] or [[amphetamine]]—mice (and humans) tend to move around a lot. High levels of dopamine essentially make the basal ganglia more sensitive to incoming bids, lowering the threshold for activating movements.^[The Hungry Brain (Stephan J. Guyenet, Ph.D.), p. 44]
