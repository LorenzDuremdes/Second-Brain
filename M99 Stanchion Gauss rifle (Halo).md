1. M99 Stanchion Gauss rifle (Halo); works on the same operational principles as other magnetic weapons such as mass drivers and Magnetic Accelerator Cannons, albeit on a much smaller scale. This system works through using a series of electromagnetic coils (an asynchronous linear induction motor) rather than chemical propellants as a source of kinetic energy.
   
   The 5.4mm/.21 caliber round is very small in comparison to most standard firearms of the era, but using the Gauss technology, the small rounds have the ability to rip targets apart, even through office buildings. This is due to the high force imparted on the round via the Gauss acceleration method. The round creates shockwaves as it passes through the target and ripping through anything not as strong as a foot (30 cm) of titanium.  In the case of material targets, this is a minor explosion and the creation of structural fractures. In the case of personnel targets, it simultaneously rips apart and pulverizes the body around the impact area. Even hits in an extremity or near-misses can be deadly.
   
   The rounds have been known to have the ability to travel great distances without affecting the trajectory, delivering enough force to punch through instacrete pylons, blow a human apart, and continue on course through an abandoned parking lot.^[https://www.halopedia.org/M99_Stanchion]
2. why was the M99 Stanchion no longer produced (Halo)?
	1. Expensive as hell, heavy and extremely cumbersome with one of the modern variants being a whopping fucking 6-7ft long.
	   
	   By that point they had already been investing more and more into fighting the Insurrection (not least the significant expense of Project MJOLNIR, development of which began in 2515), which hadn't even really begun when the Stanchion first entered production. Presumably, it was decided that the Stanchion's bulk and the cost of associated maintenance wasn't worth the expense of continuing to manufacture the weapons for mass issue. They already had plenty of them and their components warehoused (as is typical for any military equipment), enough that the Spirit of Fire still had some a decade after the end of production.
	   
	   Worth noting that in 2521, the same year production of the M99 Stanchion ended, the other branches of the UNSC (such as the Marine Corps) adopted the SRS99-AM, which the Army had already been using for decades. It's a more conventional rifle which still has plenty of long-range power and is a lot easier to issue en masse and maintain in the field.
