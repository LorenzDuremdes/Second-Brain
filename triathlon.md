# why do cyclists 'hate' triathletes?
1. I feel a collection of the other arguments, especially about the TT bikes. But also, triathletes are always solo. Riding with them is awful because they are not always use to riding in packs and often don't communicate so that they can push themselves harder.
   
   Cycling has a lot of group work. Triathlons are designed around the individual. Almost polar opposites^[https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/1brvql/comment/c99mih1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]
2. [What's behind the meme about making fun of triathletes? : r/cycling (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/1ajpf7p/whats_behind_the_meme_about_making_fun_of/)
	1. This is exactly where it comes from.
   
   Pre-indoor training you used to rely on pace to weed out the less experienced riders from the fast group, as generally the only way people got fast enough to hang in the A ride was to build up through the slower groups and develop good bunch skills.
   
   Triathletes were the exception to this. They were fast enough to hang in, but completely lacking in group riding skills. This makes a dangerous combo. Group skills are best learned and developed at slower speeds and built up over time, jumping straight into a tight bunch at 35+kph is asking for trouble, and often resulted in it.
   
   Now days with the accessibility of indoor training, power meters, and online training platforms the same problem extends well beyond triathletes. It was particularly noticeable post lockdowns.
	2. Triathletes can also be menaces on group rides, they lack pack riding skills since the majority of triathlons are not draft legal and a lot of their fitness comes from not riding bikes. They also have poor overall handling because TTâ€™s are normally flat and simple courses. The ones I have ridden with also tend to TT everything and can blast out power.
	3. Pros: triathletes are cardio GODS. truly insane breed of people.
	   
	   Cons: take terrible care of their bikes, never buy a used bike from one. Don't have any bike handling skills, they can basically only go straight and fast for a long time. Completely disregard and don't need most of the skills involved in competitive road cycling.
	   
	   Honestly it's a completely different sport. Fewer skills, more fitness. When it comes to biking anyway. We rip on them because they're not interested in bike culture or any nuance related to the sport. They just want go straight and fast.
