1. natural selection → persuasion
	1. I would need to look to the compliance professionals—the people who had been using the principles on me all my life. They know what works and what doesn’t; the law of survival of the fittest assures it. Their business is to make us comply, and their livelihoods depend on it. Those who don’t know how to get people to say yes soon fall away; those who do, stay and flourish.^[Influence, New and Expanded: The [[Psychology]] of Persuasion, p. 6]
2. how to invoke "unity" during a dyad?

## behavior
1. high vs. low chin angle → friendliness^[https://fs.blog/2013/07/building-trust/]
	1. a high chin angle might make someone feel like you're looking down at them (not always advantageous e.g. trying to appear friendly)
2. people usually don't know what they want or what motivates them, so you shouldn't abide to what they say and instead [[trust]] on your own intelligence
	1. First off, you’ve got to judge what people want by what they pursue not by what they say. You mentioned one date told you exactly what she wants, and you did all that, but she was only focused on someone who was doing something different… that should tell you what she really wants. She wants to want what she told you, but it’s actually not motivating to her - **just like I want to want vegetables, but I find myself salivating over other things**.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qoxc9t/comment/hjq0uou/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
