## performance management
1. **[[chronic training load]]**; [[chronic training load]]; an exponentially weighted average of the last 42 days of training and reflects the training you have done over the last 3 months^[https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/what-is-the-performance-management-chart/]
	1. the workouts you did 15 days ago will impact your fitness more than the workouts you did 6 weeks ago
	2. range probably depends on programming/periodization (when doing it manually(?))

# [[physiology]]
1. exercising in morning vs. afternoon → burning [[fat]]
	1. Exercising in the afternoon or evening burns more [[fat]] than exercising in the morning — and pre-workout [[caffeine]] magnifies this effect. Noncaffeinated exercise in the afternoon burns as much [[fat]] as caffeinated exercise in the morning.
