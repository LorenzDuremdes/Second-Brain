# improving
1. how can you 'spread the risk' of building a relationship with someone new?

2. does Mark Manson believe you necessarily need to learn a "skill-set" to have a conversation with a woman? + why^[Models: Attract [[Women]] Through [[Honesty]], Mark Manson]
	1. If you can have a conversation with a friend or family member, then you already possess the only “skill-set” required in attracting a woman. There’s nothing to learn, only things to do. And the fear doesn’t go away, you learn to hone it to help you.

		1. you don't need "dating experience from high school"^[https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/rt9e0j/dating_in_high_school_is_important_even_if_you/]
		2. 'good' [[sex]] is all about [[communication]] (rather than techniques)^[https://qr.ae/pGzyut, [[Franklin Veaux]]]

	1. Hey,

		The best players are quite meticulous when it comes to their game. Ponder on ways to improve and execute.
2. And while playing poker, if you play consistently, there's the well-understood notion that no matter how well you play the odds, there will be times, maybe even a string of times where you lose.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/wdishv/something_that_everyone_needs_to_hear_at_some/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]

# modern dating [[culture]]
1. why probably did "being too available" became a thing?^[https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/i6ldhp/comment/g0wpgcu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
	1. people who want the chase they want it because that's what makes them able to lie to themselves that they like the person, but when what they actually like, is to win

		people who don't need these games we are serious and ready to commit and if someone isn't matching us we don't make it a cat and mouse chase we simply say it's not working out and move on

# [[women]]
1. do girls have difficulties talking to a fit/in shape guys? + why^[https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/qgweb1/comment/hi8se4s/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]

2. is dating 'easier' for [[women]]? + why
	1. no, it's more difficult for [[women]] due to them having to filter a lot more (and sometimes experience) bad guys^[https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/swimrd/dating_isnt_easy_for_women/]

		For [[men]], dating is like dying of thirst in the desert. Not a drop of water in sight.

		For [[women]], it’s like dying of thirst in the ocean. Water is everywhere but it’s mostly toxic and full of salt.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/sztg39/comment/hy6d3rm/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
	2. For woman I think it’s probably exhausting to try and find someone who will actually be interested in something more than [[sex]].^[https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/uezsrp/comment/i6r7dqq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]

# rejection
1. [[Franklin Veaux]]' perspective on "rejection"
	1. A lot of folks are frightened that if they talk about their fantasies, they might scare off their date. Well, duh. That’s the point! You don’t want to be with someone who is not compatible with you! If someone has totally different tastes and interests, scaring them off is *exactly* what you want to do.^[https://qr.ae/pGA8iP]
2. Question: Do dumpers realized they've dumped a good person who genuinely loved you?
	1. Hi there. Dumper here.
	   
	   Yes to both. It takes a minute. In my experience, it was more delayed than anything. Kinda like in the cartoons when the coyote doesn't realize he ran off a cliff and keeps going until he looks down. Well, that's what happened. I ran with it, and didn't look down until months after the fact. But I promise, the realization that I broke up with someone who cared about me and the regret that follows is there.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/un9wco/comment/i86lpph/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
