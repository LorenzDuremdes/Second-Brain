1. "An unknown planet, populated entirely by endless forests, bathed in a cold blue light air filled with minerals, greens from recently discovered space flowers, electric yellows, deep chiaroscuros and metallic reflections. Just one spritz of NEBULA 2 delivers an unprecedented vegetable ecstasy. An adrenaline effect as if we observed a galaxy not too far away." - a note from the brand.^[https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Oliver-Co/Nebula-2-Carina-Eau-de-Parfum-46639.html]
2. This could be alien intergalactic in the sense that it is an artisanal fragrance pretending to be mainstream (normally it is vice versa) yet setting it apart from either category.
3. Â You will feel like you are in a sterile space suit in a sterile spaceship in outer space, surrounded by very non-earthly atmospheric gasses that smell weird because they are unfamiliar.
