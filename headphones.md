### Out Of Your Head
1. The first time you hear Out Of Your Head, it may not sound right. It's not the software, it's your brain!^[https://www.head-fi.org/threads/out-of-your-head-new-virtual-surround-simulator.689299/]
2. There is a lot of mental adjustment that comes with OOYH which is why a lot of people write if off without giving it a legitimate effort. You have to make psychoacoustic adjustments to the way you listen every time you make a major change in your setup.^[https://www.head-fi.org/threads/out-of-your-head-new-virtual-surround-simulator.689299/post-15840197]
3. it doesn't get closer to realism than 2.0. OOYH–if you get it right–sounds real. It is an actual audiophile tool and not a gimmick. It fits in my system and elevates it instead of degrading it. I also mean "real" in the sense that it achieves the goal of audiophile equipment to render a realistic reproduction. I know there are those who may feel that OOYH sounds fake, but it does require work to get it to sound right.^[https://www.head-fi.org/threads/out-of-your-head-new-virtual-surround-simulator.689299/post-16408462]
