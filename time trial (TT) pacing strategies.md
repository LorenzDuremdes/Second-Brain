# preparation
1. how do you like to estimate how fast (average [[speed]]) you can go?
	1. plug a course in [[myWindsock]] > put in the headwind (and elevation%) in [An interactive model-based calculator of cycling power vs. speed (gribble.org)](https://gribble.org/cycling/power_v_speed.html) > and the watts you are aiming for > try to get the same average [[speed]] in [[myWindsock]]

# intra-workout
## top tube
1. how do you like to differentiate segments (e.g. city-to-city)?
	1. with a line between the numbers
2. 100 = all out (dFRC)
3. 0 = < Z2
4. n+ = you might be able to go faster (e.g. due to coverage e.g. trees) as [[myWindsock]] doesn't account for such things (yet ~2024)
5. <u>33</u>-<u>27</u>
	1. 27 = e.g. ascending  
	2. 33 = descending  
	3. average is usually in between (or try to create intervals where this is the case)
	4. <u>33</u> underscored goes before 27 in this case to denote that's the [[speed]] you start with (useful for e.g. calibrating power/RPE) and 27 you end with
	5. **33>27** → you start with 33, keep this pace, and (slowly) end up with 27 (i.e. don't really have to take into account an average)
		1. e.g. downhill followed by flat
	2. 1 interval is usually determined when ascending vs. descending (or when wind direction changes)
	3. 33+27 → the average is a bit higher than the average of the 2 numbers (e.g. 31 instead of 30 in this case)
	4. 30±2 = maximum = 32 km/h and minimum = 28 km/h with 30 km/h average
		1. e.g. useful when it's unclear where the highest/lowest speeds are

# execution
1. how can you know via [[myWindsock]] that the weather changed (e.g. stronger headwind) after already having prepared the pacing on the top tube?
	1. if it recommends higher/lower speeds at the chosen intervals (or average [[speed]] (at a segment)
