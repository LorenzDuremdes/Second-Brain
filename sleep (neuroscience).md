1. At the first point of integration, the [[glutamate receptor|glutamatergic neurons]] conveying excessive warmth synapse at glutamatergic neurons in the [[median preoptic nucleus|MnPO]], whose output initiates cooling by promoting [[vasodilation]] and switching off [[brown adipose tissue|brown fat]] [[adaptive thermogenesis]|thermogenesis] (Morrison and Nakamura, 2011) (Figure 4)
   
   Signal integration in the [[preoptic area|preoptic hypothalamus]]. Warmth on the skin stimulates sensory inputs, through the [[parabrachial nuclei|LPb]], to preoptic [[neuronal nitric oxide synthase|nitrergic]]-glutamatergic neurons that initiate simultaneous [[non-rapid eye movement sleep|NREM]] and body cooling. This maybe through activation of separate [[GABA receptor|GABAergic neurons]] for [[sleep]] and [[hypothermia]] in the [[medial preoptic nucleus|MPO]] and LPO, but they may also activate [[galanin|galinergic]]-GABAergic neurons to initiate sleep and body cooling. The synaptic role of NO is unknown in these circuits but potential sites are labelled. NREM is initiated by inhibition of arousal nuclei, including the TMN and the LH. Others are likely to be involved. Body cooling is facilitated by activation of DMH and inhibition of rRPA neurons to induce vasodilation and downregulation of BAT thermogenesis. Inputs to the lateral parabrachial and the preoptic area are modulated by [[agouti-related peptide|AgRP neuron]]-mediate inhibition from the arcuate. These detect [[satiety|hunger]] and put a break on NREM. Satiety induces activation of [[pro-opiomelanocortin|POMC neurons]], that also express [[TRPV1|TRPV1]], are permissive for NREM and induce local inhibition of AgRP neurons. Nitrergic-glutamate neurons may respond to [[leptin]] through the leptin Rb, as do AgRP and POMC neurons. They, or a separate local population, may also respond to changes in brain temperature through the TRPM2 ion channel.

Skin warming activates a pathway that runs through the spinal cord and is relayed by glutamatergic neurons in the lateral parabrachial nucleus. This activates the Nos1-positive glutamatergic neurons in MnPO-MPO whose output drives GABAergic neurons in both MPO and GABAergic neurons in the lateral preoptic (LPO) areas. Others have demonstrated that activating glutamatergic cells in MnPO-MPO induces hypothermia and that GABAergic neurons in the MnPO-MPO area do not [[homeothermy|regulate body temperature]]. We suggest the MPO GABA neurons inhibit [[monoamine neurotransmitter|monoaminergic]] arousal pathways, such as the histaminergic tuberomammillary nucleus, resulting in sleep; by contrast, the LPO GABA neurons inhibit both heat-promoting glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DM), resulting in body cooling.

The synaptic pathway for how skin warmth initiates sleep would start with sensory TRPM2 ion channels in the skin that are stimulated by mild (non-painful) external warming. From there, the excitatory pathway would ascend via the lateral parabrachial nucleus. In particular, glutamatergic neurons in the lateral parabrachial nucleus convey signals for temperature place preference, and these cells are likely to be involved in our thermal place preference protocol (see Figure 1). From the lateral parabrachial nucleus, the glutamatergic pathway continues to the MnPO-MPO [[hypothalamus]] where, in turn, the nitrergic/glutamatergic neurons would be activated (Figure 6). These cells would then excite two groups of neurons: the GABAergic cells recently defined in the lateral preoptic area that elicit hypothermia and the sleep-promoting GABAergic cells in the MPO area identified here in our study. In this way, external warmth, sleep induction, and body cooling would be actively linked (Figure 6).^[[A Neuronal Hub Binding Sleep Initiation and Body Cooling in Response to a Warm External Stimulus - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6078908/)] ![[Conceptual Circuit Model for How External Warming Induces and Links Sleep and Body Cooling.png]]
