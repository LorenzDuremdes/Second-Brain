1. how much training load do you need to get your "Fitness" to a given number? (e.g. Intervals.icu)^[https://forum.intervals.icu/t/fitness-score-or-how-fit-is-fit/4485]
	1. e.g. an average of 50 CTL/day results in a "Fitness" of 50
		1. Fitness ≠ fitness (e.g. you can still make progress while keeping CTL the same)
2. no evidence supports the quantitative use of TL data to manipulate future training with the purpose of preventing injury
   
   our message to practitioners is to stop seeking overly simplistic solutions to complex problems and instead embrace the risks and uncertainty inherent in the training process and injury prevention^[[Training Load and Its Role in Injury Prevention, Part I: Back to the Future - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7534945/)]

1. chronic training load → [[fatigue resistance (road cycling)|fatigue resistance]]
	1. the former can increase the latter (especially multi-hour or multi-day events)
		1. I just wrapped up an overload week at the end of build. Hit an all-[[time]] high CTL of 130. Feeling surprisingly good, not run down. The final 2 days were a stage race and I hit power PR on Saturday’s stage (.82 IF for almost 6 hours). Feeling like I can make power forever right now, hope this holds until Unbound.^[https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/ctl-check-may-2024/90374/329?u=lorenz_duremdes] ![[grwoolf, chronic training load, TrainerRoad.png]]
2. might there be an optimum level of fatigue in relation to CTL + why
	1. perhaps (as with [[resistance training]]) as recovering from 99% to 100% takes exponentially longer than e.g. 80% to 90%, but you don't want to be too fatigued either as that brings CTL down as well (even if the adaptations are increased by increasing 'basal [[task failure]] %')
3. fast- vs. slow-twitch dominant → optimal intensity for CTL
	1. faster-twitch dominant might benefit more with incorporating more lower-intensity workouts?
		1. faster-twitch dominance might also increase the stimulus despite also increasing fatigue at higher intensities?
