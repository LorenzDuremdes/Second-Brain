# [[sports data science]]
1. how much training load do you need to get your "Fitness" to a given number? (e.g. Intervals.icu)^[https://forum.intervals.icu/t/fitness-score-or-how-fit-is-fit/4485]
	1. e.g. an average of 50 CTL/day results in a "Fitness" of 50
		1. Fitness ≠ fitness (e.g. you can still make progress while keeping CTL the same)

# [[physiology]]
1. chronic training load → [[fatigue resistance (road cycling)|fatigue resistance]]
	1. the former can increase the latter (especially multi-hour or multi-day events)
		1. I just wrapped up an overload week at the end of build. Hit an all-[[time]] high CTL of 130. Feeling surprisingly good, not run down. The final 2 days were a stage race and I hit power PR on Saturday’s stage (.82 IF for almost 6 hours). Feeling like I can make power forever right now, hope this holds until Unbound.^[https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/ctl-check-may-2024/90374/329?u=lorenz_duremdes] ![[grwoolf, chronic training load, TrainerRoad.png]]
2. fast- vs. slow-twitch dominant → optimal intensity for CTL
	1. faster-twitch dominant might benefit more with incorporating more lower-intensity workouts?
		1. faster-twitch dominance might also increase the stimulus despite also increasing fatigue at higher intensities?
