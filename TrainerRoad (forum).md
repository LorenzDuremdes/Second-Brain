# [Difference in race and workout performance](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/difference-in-race-and-workout-performance/93171)
1. With a bigger Functional Reserve Capacity, I would imagine both: Being able to hold a _higher_ power above FTP for the same duration as well as being able to hold the same power you currently can do, but for longer. You also would perhaps be further away from task failure (as you have more glycogen left in your tank), so this could reduce RPE as well.
	   
	With those 30/30s (and principle of specificity), I would imagine these workouts could perhaps be a better (more specific) way to be able to push into those surges more often than e.g. 3m on and 8 minutes recovery. With only 30s of recovery, these intervals can train your aerobic system alongside as well.
	   
	For progression, you could try to first be able to hit the duration above FTP that the event demands (I would imagine for this event that adding more and more 30s intervals would perhaps be better than increasing the duration (e.g. 30s > 35s)), and then perhaps decrease the duration of the resting intervals or even increase the intensity during the recoveries (although I have limited experience in these types of events, so I am not sure whether this way of progressive overload is most optimal or not).
2. You could perhaps try to design a workout where you indeed try to implement the alternative strategy you are mentioning at the end, not per se to repeatedly train by mimicking the race situation, but more or less as a way of testing yourself beforehand. You would only have to do this once in a while as a sort of benchmark. Perhaps this is more where your strength (potential) could be.

# [Endurance Ride plus scheduled workout](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/endurance-ride-plus-scheduled-workout/93175)
1. Depends on what you are training for and your individual physiology.
   
   Some guidelines I can think of:

1. Monday your hardest workout (but not so hard that you can’t do your workout at Wednesday or even Friday)
2. Wednesday an easier workout
3. Friday a harder workout (as you now have Saturday and occassionally Sunday to recover from)
   
   Perhaps for progressive overload, increase the density e.g. do the same workouts you did last week, but now switch the Friday workout to Wednesday (i.e. 2 hard workouts in a shorter timespan).
   
   And the week after you do 3 hard workouts, the week after again the same workouts but with higher intensity/less rest… etc. (which also increases CTL slowly over time).
   
   In the same trend, you could do the 2-hour endurance ride after your 1-hour scheduled workout to begin with and see how you feel, and progress with doing the 2-hour endurance ride _before_ your 1-hour scheduled workout (i.e. progressive overload by doing it less fresh).
4. I’m not too familiar with the TR plans. Perhaps what you could do, if you are able to do this (physiologically), is to increase the TSS/CTL or keep doing workouts during the weeks even if the plan demands a recovery week (again I’m not sure how this plan looks like, but looking at your graph above, I can see some weeks where TSS is low or perhaps even zero). This could massively help with getting the CTL as high as possible, which could be very beneficial for something that last multiple days in a row i.e. you will (hopefully) recover much better from the ITT as well as the 150 km hilly route the next day if your CTL is higher.
   
   Although I wouldn’t skip the last recommended recovery days/week (unless you are very experienced and know very precisely whether you will be fresh enough or not).
   
   You could start experimenting with this via easy and short workouts to begin with during the recovery days/week and see if it doesn’t hinder your dedicated training days after the plan demands a rest week.
   
   For a bonus, perhaps you find this research paper interesting, which basically says that increasing your volume (in an unsustainable manner, but only for the short-term such that you are recovered during the race), can further improve (time trial) performance:
   
   [Effects of tapering on performance in endurance athletes: A systematic review and meta-analysis - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10171681/)
   
> The results showed that a tapering strategy with a reduction in training volume of **41–60% that maintained training intensity and frequency, lasted ≤ 21 days**, and used progressive or step tapering could significantly improve the TT of endurance athletes (P < 0.05; Table 2)

> For further exploration the training features of overload period preceding the taper, we further tracked the original research studies and found that the mean training intensity of pre-taper overload training remained at 85–95% of maximum heart rate (HRmax), an **increase of 23–26% over the mean training intensity of normal training**. This was consistent with the findings of Thomas et al. that **an increase in pre-taper training load of approximately 20–30% was effective in improving post-taper performance**. Another study found that pre-taper overload training produced higher training-induced adaptations and facilitated supercompensation. The studies by Hellard et al. and Le Meur et al. showed that improvements in V˙O2max and cardiac output of athletes who underwent overload training pre-taper were significantly higher than those of athletes who underwent conventional tapering only

…Unless the TR Gran Fondo Plan already has something like this implemented.

Another option could be to select the Mid (or even High) Volume Gran Fondo plan and squeeze them on your MWF (if able to recover from this).

But to simply summarize: I think for this 3-day event, a focus on ending with as high as possible CTL would be a high priority.

# I just can't find the energy blocks in my schedule for weight training
1. To add on to this thread, I personally like to follow Dr. Mike Israetel’s guidelines (or volume landmarks): Training Volume Landmarks for Muscle Growth – RP Strength (this article also mentions how you can find your own volume landmarks).

If you go to “FREE CONTENT > ARTICLES” you can find the general volume landmarks per muscle group e.g. Calves Hypertrophy: Maximizing Muscle Growth with Effective Training – RP Strength says the following:

I collected them all here for myself in a document:

To fully make use of this system, it is advisable to also read more about his way of how he programs resistance training (e.g. from Minimum Effective Volume > Maximum Recoverable Volume). Their YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@RenaissancePeriodization/ has a lot of information on this (and more).

Although in your case, I would try to stay at MV and do 1 or more muscle groups at MEV or perhaps even above. If you have recovery days/weeks programmed in your endurance training, you could also simultaneously increase the strength training volume in the meanwhile.

Another concept that could be interesting to delve in to, would be ‘**hybrid athlete**’: What Is Hybrid Training? Here’s All You Need to Know (menshealth.com)

>**Excerpt**
>‘Not if it’s done properly,’ says Crawley. ‘There is a misconception with hybrid training that more is better. Or that you should take 100% of a running programme and 100% of a lifting programme and put them together. The maths just doesn’t add up. When people stack up the volume like that, that’s when injuries and burnout can occur.’
>
>On a week-by-week basis hybrid athletes should be striving for ‘the minimum effective volume for the maximum effective adaptation’. ‘Essentially that means doing as little training as possible to adapt as much as possible. We’re not pushing people to the point where they’re absolutely destroyed,’ he says.

Or: What Is a Hybrid Athlete - Nick Bare, Alex Viada Explain Training (menshealth.com)

>**Excerpt**
>What I got instead was a firsthand lesson in the challenges of pursuing multiple fitness goals at once. Instead of crushing the marathon, I finished nearly 20 minutes later than I’d hoped, in 3:23.30. Even worse, I left hobbled by a hamstring issue. All the strain—from running far and lifting heavy—was too much for me. Instead of celebrating an awesome feat of strength and endurance, I wound up spending the next three months rehabbing that hamstring.

>I’m reminded of all this whenever I scroll through social media posts of jacked guys running major mileage—and yes, it’s a little triggering. Because somehow, at least according to Instagram, there are a bunch of people who consistently run far and lift incredibly heavy.
>
>They call themselves “hybrid athletes,” and they excel at the blend of training styles that crippled me, simultaneously adding strength while pushing their cardio. I know this because I keep seeing their posts (thank you, Instagram and TikTok algorithms). These include posts from a fitness personality named Nick Bare (959k Instagram followers), who serves as an evangelist for the training style.

# [Legs are sore or feel great after a race](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/legs-are-sore-or-feel-great-after-a-race/93134)
1. Some things I can think of:
	1. What Everman mentioned (they are more fatiguing e.g. faster-twitch muscle fibers (which also recover slower) as well as using up more glycogen + how close you were to task failure (per effort))
	2. How many carbohydrates you took around/after the race (for recovery afterward)
	3. The CTL you had at the time (as well as what workouts you did/adapted to and whether they reflected the race well or not)
	4. How fresh you were during the race
	5. Perhaps when your legs don’t feel great during the race, you (unconsciously) back off a bit, which decreases the strain, so you have less to recover from
	6. Perhaps you modified your bike in the meanwhile (e.g. saddle higher/lower, bike geometry e.g. TT bike vs. more upright mountain bike)
	7. Differences in cadences/torque with their respective power outputs
	8. Whether you did some active recovery/cooling down/light workout (immediately/a couple hours/a day afterward)
	9. Warming-up beforehand
