# [Difference in race and workout performance](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/difference-in-race-and-workout-performance/93171)
1. With a bigger Functional Reserve Capacity, I would imagine both: Being able to hold a _higher_ power above FTP for the same duration as well as being able to hold the same power you currently can do, but for longer. You also would perhaps be further away from task failure (as you have more glycogen left in your tank), so this could reduce RPE as well.
	   
	With those 30/30s (and principle of specificity), I would imagine these workouts could perhaps be a better (more specific) way to be able to push into those surges more often than e.g. 3m on and 8 minutes recovery. With only 30s of recovery, these intervals can train your aerobic system alongside as well.
	   
	For progression, you could try to first be able to hit the duration above FTP that the event demands (I would imagine for this event that adding more and more 30s intervals would perhaps be better than increasing the duration (e.g. 30s > 35s)), and then perhaps decrease the duration of the resting intervals or even increase the intensity during the recoveries (although I have limited experience in these types of events, so I am not sure whether this way of progressive overload is most optimal or not).
2. You could perhaps try to design a workout where you indeed try to implement the alternative strategy you are mentioning at the end, not per se to repeatedly train by mimicking the race situation, but more or less as a way of testing yourself beforehand. You would only have to do this once in a while as a sort of benchmark. Perhaps this is more where your strength (potential) could be.

# [Endurance Ride plus scheduled workout](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/endurance-ride-plus-scheduled-workout/93175)
1. Depends on what you are training for and your individual physiology.
   
   Some guidelines I can think of:

1. Monday your hardest workout (but not so hard that you can’t do your workout at Wednesday or even Friday)
2. Wednesday an easier workout
3. Friday a harder workout (as you now have Saturday and occassionally Sunday to recover from)
   
   Perhaps for progressive overload, increase the density e.g. do the same workouts you did last week, but now switch the Friday workout to Wednesday (i.e. 2 hard workouts in a shorter timespan).
   
   And the week after you do 3 hard workouts, the week after again the same workouts but with higher intensity/less rest… etc. (which also increases CTL slowly over time).
   
   In the same trend, you could do the 2-hour endurance ride after your 1-hour scheduled workout to begin with and see how you feel, and progress with doing the 2-hour endurance ride _before_ your 1-hour scheduled workout (i.e. progressive overload by doing it less fresh).
4. I’m not too familiar with the TR plans. Perhaps what you could do, if you are able to do this (physiologically), is to increase the TSS/CTL or keep doing workouts during the weeks even if the plan demands a recovery week (again I’m not sure how this plan looks like, but looking at your graph above, I can see some weeks where TSS is low or perhaps even zero). This could massively help with getting the CTL as high as possible, which could be very beneficial for something that last multiple days in a row i.e. you will (hopefully) recover much better from the ITT as well as the 150 km hilly route the next day if your CTL is higher.
   
   Although I wouldn’t skip the last recommended recovery days/week (unless you are very experienced and know very precisely whether you will be fresh enough or not).
   
   You could start experimenting with this via easy and short workouts to begin with during the recovery days/week and see if it doesn’t hinder your dedicated training days after the plan demands a rest week.
   
   For a bonus, perhaps you find this research paper interesting, which basically says that increasing your volume (in an unsustainable manner, but only for the short-term such that you are recovered during the race), can further improve (time trial) performance:
   
   [Effects of tapering on performance in endurance athletes: A systematic review and meta-analysis - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10171681/)
   
> The results showed that a tapering strategy with a reduction in training volume of **41–60% that maintained training intensity and frequency, lasted ≤ 21 days**, and used progressive or step tapering could significantly improve the TT of endurance athletes (P < 0.05; Table 2)

> For further exploration the training features of overload period preceding the taper, we further tracked the original research studies and found that the mean training intensity of pre-taper overload training remained at 85–95% of maximum heart rate (HRmax), an **increase of 23–26% over the mean training intensity of normal training**. This was consistent with the findings of Thomas et al. that **an increase in pre-taper training load of approximately 20–30% was effective in improving post-taper performance**. Another study found that pre-taper overload training produced higher training-induced adaptations and facilitated supercompensation. The studies by Hellard et al. and Le Meur et al. showed that improvements in V˙O2max and cardiac output of athletes who underwent overload training pre-taper were significantly higher than those of athletes who underwent conventional tapering only

…Unless the TR Gran Fondo Plan already has something like this implemented.

Another option could be to select the Mid (or even High) Volume Gran Fondo plan and squeeze them on your MWF (if able to recover from this).

But to simply summarize: I think for this 3-day event, a focus on ending with as high as possible CTL would be a high priority.

It would increase the training load every week, which could drive more adaptations in a shorter timeframe.

2 hours at something like 70% intensity, would give a TSS of 97 per session. For reference, if you do the 150 km race in ~5 hours at let’s say an average Normalized Power of 76% intensity (lower Z3), that would give a TSS of 287.

The additional 2-hour endurance rides would allow you to both race faster due to potentially achieving more adaptations in the meanwhile building up to the race, but it would also increase your race performance due to simply being able to handle (and recover from) a higher training load i.e. being more recovered from the ITT would mean you can put a better performance next day with the 150 km route, same with the 3rd day 120 km.

You could start with adding this 2-hour endurance ride on top of Friday as you have 2 days to recover from this and later on move this session (or add extra Z2 sessions) on top of Monday and Wednesday.

For reference, these are the general guidelines in terms of ramp rate:

**Source:** Training and Racing with a Power Meter (Hunter Allen, Andrew R. Coggan), p. 228

So even going with the highest value that’s sustainable/safe long-term (+10 TSS/day every 14–28 days), adding another 2-hour Z2 ride at an intensity of 70% (97 TSS) is something you should add at a maximum of every ~19–39 days.

> For example, the highest continual CTL loads we have seen have been in riders at the Tour de France who can maintain a CTL between 150 and 160 for most of the year. After the Tour, they have a CTL of 170 to 180. (Ask any rider after the Tour de France if they would like to do another one and you’ll get a firm “No,” which indicates that a hypothetical genetic limit on CTL could be somewhere between 180 and 200). If they started the Tour at 150 CTL and ended at 170 CTL, **their ramp rate would be in the 7 TSS/day range, so even the best riders in the world have a relatively shallow ramp rate when approaching their limit**.  
> **Source**: Training and Racing with a Power Meter (Hunter Allen, Andrew R. Coggan), p. 227

You have plenty of time until the race in September/October. Adding another 2-hour Z2 every month and in August you already increased your CTL with those Z2 rides with ~42 (3x97 TSS Z2), which can be a lot depending on where you currently are + the TrainerRoad plan probably also ramps up over time.

# [I just can't find the energy blocks in my schedule for weight training](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/i-just-cant-find-the-energy-blocks-in-my-schedule-for-weight-training/92500)
1. To add on to this thread, I personally like to follow Dr. Mike Israetel’s guidelines (or volume landmarks): Training Volume Landmarks for Muscle Growth – RP Strength (this article also mentions how you can find your own volume landmarks).

If you go to “FREE CONTENT > ARTICLES” you can find the general volume landmarks per muscle group e.g. Calves Hypertrophy: Maximizing Muscle Growth with Effective Training – RP Strength says the following:

I collected them all here for myself in a document:

To fully make use of this system, it is advisable to also read more about his way of how he programs resistance training (e.g. from Minimum Effective Volume > Maximum Recoverable Volume). Their YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@RenaissancePeriodization/ has a lot of information on this (and more).

Although in your case, I would try to stay at MV and do 1 or more muscle groups at MEV or perhaps even above. If you have recovery days/weeks programmed in your endurance training, you could also simultaneously increase the strength training volume in the meanwhile.

Another concept that could be interesting to delve in to, would be ‘**hybrid athlete**’: What Is Hybrid Training? Here’s All You Need to Know (menshealth.com)

>**Excerpt**
>‘Not if it’s done properly,’ says Crawley. ‘There is a misconception with hybrid training that more is better. Or that you should take 100% of a running programme and 100% of a lifting programme and put them together. The maths just doesn’t add up. When people stack up the volume like that, that’s when injuries and burnout can occur.’
>
>On a week-by-week basis hybrid athletes should be striving for ‘the minimum effective volume for the maximum effective adaptation’. ‘Essentially that means doing as little training as possible to adapt as much as possible. We’re not pushing people to the point where they’re absolutely destroyed,’ he says.

Or: What Is a Hybrid Athlete - Nick Bare, Alex Viada Explain Training (menshealth.com)

>**Excerpt**
>What I got instead was a firsthand lesson in the challenges of pursuing multiple fitness goals at once. Instead of crushing the marathon, I finished nearly 20 minutes later than I’d hoped, in 3:23.30. Even worse, I left hobbled by a hamstring issue. All the strain—from running far and lifting heavy—was too much for me. Instead of celebrating an awesome feat of strength and endurance, I wound up spending the next three months rehabbing that hamstring.
>
>I’m reminded of all this whenever I scroll through social media posts of jacked guys running major mileage—and yes, it’s a little triggering. Because somehow, at least according to Instagram, there are a bunch of people who consistently run far and lift incredibly heavy.
>
>They call themselves “hybrid athletes,” and they excel at the blend of training styles that crippled me, simultaneously adding strength while pushing their cardio. I know this because I keep seeing their posts (thank you, Instagram and TikTok algorithms). These include posts from a fitness personality named Nick Bare (959k Instagram followers), who serves as an evangelist for the training style.

# [I need your help with workouts](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/i-need-your-help-with-workouts/93006)
1. I personally like to replenish my workouts with as much carbohydrates as possible (e.g. I would consume 100 g carbohydrates when burning 400 calories). This can be done more easily (or your nutrition can be less strict carbohydrate-wise) when doing lower intensity workouts (as more calories are coming from your fat storage).

Another way would be to follow this guideline:

Source: Rethinking the 60% Carbohydrates Rule (trainingpeaks.com)

Sometimes, I even like to intentionally do some active recovery (Z1) a couple hours after an intense workout (or 15–45m after having a big evening meal e.g. to prevent reactive hypoglycemia) in order to be able to consume more carbohydrates without per se gaining weight (or having to be less strict carbohydrate-wise in my daily meal plannings). Usually, that would be at 45% of my FTP (~125 W) for 30m, which burns ~200 calories = 50 g of extra carbs (which hopefully helps with feeling better, recovery, etc).

Filling your off days with Z1/2 _coupled with more carbohydrate intake_ could perhaps aid in recovery, feeling better, etc. (as long as you keep their durations, to start with and test the waters, short enough as well e.g. start with something that’s relatively short for you and see how you feel).

I personally like to do my recovery days/week somewhere at maintenance volume as well as low intensity (rather than completely off) to keep as much fitness as possible while allowing fatigue to drop. I tend to feel a lot better on my first hard workout after my active recovery days/week.

You can maintain your fitness while doing less for a pretty long time according to this article:

Maintaining Physical Performance: The Minimal Dose of Exerci… : The Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research (lww.com)

In general populations, endurance performance can be maintained for up to 15 weeks when training frequency is reduced to as little as 2 sessions per week or when exercise volume is reduced by 33–66% (as low as 13–26 minutes per session), as long as exercise intensity (exercising heart rate) is maintained.

To maintain long-term endurance (i.e., maximal bouts of exercise lasting ∼1–3 hours) in general populations:

- The minimal exercise frequency is not known. Therefore, we conservatively recommend maintaining exercise frequency at or near the individual’s typical training level.
- Exercise volume can be reduced by 33% (as little as 26 minutes per session), as long as exercise frequency and intensity are maintained.
- Exercise intensity must be maintained as high as reasonably possible (at least as high as the individual’s typical training intensity).

The article (at the end) also mentions how to maintain maximal bouts of exercise lasting ∼4–8 minutes, V̇o2max, 1RM strength, etc.

The way I do it is by simply taking my CTL and multiplying it by roughly 0.66 (and distribute this TSS with as high frequency as possible (~6 days), with the last day before ramping again usually being an active recovery (Z1) only day).

Another option could be this guideline (Intensity- and Duration-Based Options to Regulate Endurance Training - PMC (nih.gov)):

This article from TrainerRoad is a pretty nice one: [How to Use Carbs for Maximum Performance - TrainerRoad Blog](https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/how-to-use-carbs-for-maximum-performance/)

Especially:

> Glucose and fructose are interesting because they use different pathways in the body. In simple terms, glucose is sent directly into the bloodstream, and fructose is sent to the liver to be converted to glucose. Because these two simple sugars have different metabolic pathways, finding an optimal ratio has been at the center of seeing how many carbs per hour of cycling to consume.
> 
> The problem is that our GI system can only process a certain amount of carbohydrates at a given time. Once you exceed that limit, GI distress becomes an issue. **For a long time, the standard advice has been 60-90 grams of carbs per hour using a 2:1 glucose to fructose ratio. However, research is emerging that shows that upwards of 140g/hr can be absorbed using a 1:1 ratio.**

The cheapest form is table sugar (sucrose), which has a 1:1 ratio in glucose:fructose. The maximum concentration, while still being somewhat of a liquid, lies somewhere at 2 grams of table sugar per ml of water (although this will result in something very, very sweet), so I personally like to do 1 g of sucrose per ml within a flask I carry with me (a 300 ml flask with 150 g of sugar and 150 ml of water would be enough for ~1.5h in your case). And then you can add another bottle that’s more aimed at hydration (with 1 g of sugar per 3 or 4 ml of water i.e. a 500 ml bottle has roughly 100–125 g of carbohydrates).

> # [Study: is table sugar the ideal fuel? : r/Velo (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/u997ki/study_is_table_sugar_the_ideal_fuel/)
> 
> In this study by Hearris et al. ([https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/japplphysiol.00091.2022](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/japplphysiol.00091.2022)), they have studied fit cyclists with different fueling strategies. Their conclusions are pretty interesting I believe: _“We conclude 120 g·h-1 CHO (in a 1:0.8 ratio of maltodextrin or glucose:fructose) is a practically tolerable strategy to promote high CHO availability and oxidation during exercise.”_
> 
> Table sugar happens to be almost perfect for this, since it provides a 1:1 glucose:fructose ratio. From just skimming the paper I am not sure if they do know if the 1:0.8 ratio is why they can also get up to 120g/hr, but it seems likely.
> 
> Does anyone have any experience with fueling like this?

Best way to dissolve the sugar quickly, would be to boil the water and mix it with the sugar.

Adding some sodium could be a good thing as well:

> [How Much Sodium Should You Consume? Bicycling.com](https://www.bicycling.com/health-nutrition/a20030582/recommended-sodium/)  
> On the bike, a good rule of thumb is to consume between 500 and 700 milligrams per hour, which is about how much you can absorb within that time, Hinton says. Start with that amount and see how you tolerate it. If you feel sluggish or dizzy, or experience muscle cramps, you may need to increase it.

I would take small sips every now and then and spreading it over the hour to hit whatever carbs/hr your target is.

Consuming some carbohydrates **pre**-workout (somewhere within 15m before starting the workout to e.g. prevent reactive hypoglycemia or feeling bad^[[Pre-Workout Nutrition: Data-Driven Ways to Plan Meal Timing (Ask a Cycling Coach 327)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0S5iPm-hjs&t=360s)]) might also help rather than trying to consume it all **intra**-workout to prevent e.g. gastrointestinal problems (especially more likely at higher intensities).

# [Legs are sore or feel great after a race](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/legs-are-sore-or-feel-great-after-a-race/93134)
1. Some things I can think of:
	1. What Everman mentioned (they are more fatiguing e.g. faster-twitch muscle fibers (which also recover slower) as well as using up more glycogen + how close you were to task failure (per effort))
	2. How many carbohydrates you took around/after the race (for recovery afterward)
	3. The CTL you had at the time (as well as what workouts you did/adapted to and whether they reflected the race well or not)
	4. How fresh you were during the race
	5. Perhaps when your legs don’t feel great during the race, you (unconsciously) back off a bit, which decreases the strain, so you have less to recover from
	6. Perhaps you modified your bike in the meanwhile (e.g. saddle higher/lower, bike geometry e.g. TT bike vs. more upright mountain bike)
	7. Differences in cadences/torque with their respective power outputs
	8. Whether you did some active recovery/cooling down/light workout (immediately/a couple hours/a day afterward)
	9. Warming-up beforehand

# [Problems with outdoor workouts](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/problems-with-outdoor-workouts/93228)
I would do it by having a target/ballpark TSS beforehand e.g. 1h Z2@70% = 49 TSS.

Then I would look a bit at the terrain. If it requires many accelerations, perhaps try to stay around ~68% IF (coupled with the accelerations bringing Normalized Power up might bring you somewhat close to the 49 TSS). If the terrain requires a lot of coasting or being in Z1, however, perhaps it’s even better to stay slightly above (like ~72% IF). E.g. if you coast or are in Z1 for a total of 5 minutes, then you ‘effectively’ did a 55-minute workout instead of an hour (which is still ~45–48 TSS), but you need an average of ~71–73 IF for it to be 49 TSS again (or try to make up for it by cycling a bit longer or perhaps in your other workouts).

You could try to increase the intensity slightly when going uphill or with a headwind and vice versa if your goal is to practice some pacing as well.

So there’s no exact need to keep Z2 _constant/steady_ at something like a precise continuous value 70% IF (or even be 100% in Z2) for it to be considered an effective workout (like you could do more easily on a trainer). Nor do the short breaks/coasting in between for a couple seconds cause a significant reduction in adaptations or something like that.

# [Should I go to mid volume from high volume?](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/should-i-go-to-mid-volume-from-high-volume/93205)
I can’t give an answer to what might be the most optimal choice, but I can share some knowledge that might help you make a more informed decision.

Depending on the ramp rate (how much you are increasing your training load every week), if it somewhat falls according to the following values (or even below it), you could try to keep doing what you are doing right now and see whether your body can adapt to the total weekly training load better over time (e.g. feeling better on the Mondays over time):

**Source**: Training and Racing with a Power Meter (Hunter Allen, Andrew R. Coggan), p. 228

Switching to a plan with a lower weekly training load would probably still give you fitness adaptations, but slower in the same timeframe.

Also make sure you get enough carbohydrates and calories. I sometimes like to eat a +100 caloric surplus on a very hard day (consisting mainly of carbs i.e. 25 g in this case). Perhaps this could help especially on your long endurance ride on Sunday.

Source: Rethinking the 60% Carbohydrates Rule (trainingpeaks.com)

Planning the long endurance ride a couple hours earlier on Sunday (if possible) could also mean a couple more hours of recovery until the next workout on Monday.

# [The Bike Fitting Mega-Thread](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/the-bike-fitting-mega-thread/10527)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1TQcOC1VLM

According to this video (from a bike fitter), a **too far forward saddle** can be recognized by:
- A lack of hamstring engagement and overengagement of the quadriceps (if you have a power meter that displays Pedal Smoothness, you would see it being less 'round' with bigger spikes);
- Tricep fatigue (or even shoulders) as too much upper bodyweight is being carried by them (rather than on the saddle).

Here's a video when the saddle might be **too far aft**:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvUXJ3U5_wM

He recommends putting it as far back as possible, riding it, and then moving it forward until the weight starts to be too much on the hands (which can also be tested by momentarily riding without your hands on the handlebars and seeing whether you are just as easily able to do that or not at every iteration) or the pedal motion no longer feels smooth.

Pedal cleat position depend more on the activity you are engaging in.

A more midfoot cleat position could be better for time trialists or steady state efforts (both by reducing things like calves fatiguing, but also allowing the stem to be lower, as the saddle can be put lower as well, possibly improving aerodynamics without reducing power output):
https://youtu.be/OPASHllkqJM?si=x4UQrZ8PgwdlHepf&t=629
A possible downside of a more midfloot cleat position is that it can lower sprint performance (rate of force development, mostly) i.e. a more forward cleat position might be better for things like criteriums.

Another interesting video to consider a more midfoot cleat position:
