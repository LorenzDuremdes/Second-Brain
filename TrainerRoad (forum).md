# [Legs are sore or feel great after a race](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/legs-are-sore-or-feel-great-after-a-race/93134)
1. Some things I can think of:
	1. What Everman mentioned (they are more fatiguing e.g. faster-twitch muscle fibers (which also recover slower) as well as using up more glycogen + how close you were to task failure (per effort))
	2. How many carbohydrates you took around/after the race (for recovery afterward)
	3. The CTL you had at the time (as well as what workouts you did/adapted to and whether they reflected the race well or not)
	4. How fresh you were during the race
	5. Perhaps when your legs don’t feel great during the race, you (unconsciously) back off a bit, which decreases the strain, so you have less to recover from
	6. Perhaps you modified your bike in the meanwhile (e.g. saddle higher/lower, bike geometry e.g. TT bike vs. more upright mountain bike)
	7. Differences in cadences/torque with their respective power outputs
	8. Whether you did some active recovery/cooling down/light workout (immediately/a couple hours/a day afterward)
	9. Warming-up beforehand

# [Difference in race and workout performance](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/difference-in-race-and-workout-performance/93171)
1. With a bigger Functional Reserve Capacity, I would imagine both: Being able to hold a _higher_ power above FTP for the same duration as well as being able to hold the same power you currently can do, but for longer. You also would perhaps be further away from task failure (as you have more glycogen left in your tank), so this could reduce RPE as well.
	   
	With those 30/30s (and principle of specificity), I would imagine these workouts could perhaps be a better (more specific) way to be able to push into those surges more often than e.g. 3m on and 8 minutes recovery. With only 30s of recovery, these intervals can train your aerobic system alongside as well.
	   
	For progression, you could try to first be able to hit the duration above FTP that the event demands (I would imagine for this event that adding more and more 30s intervals would perhaps be better than increasing the duration (e.g. 30s > 35s)), and then perhaps decrease the duration of the resting intervals or even increase the intensity during the recoveries (although I have limited experience in these types of events, so I am not sure whether this way of progressive overload is most optimal or not).
2. You could perhaps try to design a workout where you indeed try to implement the alternative strategy you are mentioning at the end, not per se to repeatedly train by mimicking the race situation, but more or less as a way of testing yourself beforehand. You would only have to do this once in a while as a sort of benchmark. Perhaps this is more where your strength (potential) could be.

# [Endurance Ride plus scheduled workout](https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/endurance-ride-plus-scheduled-workout/93175)
1. Depends on what you are training for and your individual physiology.
   
   Some guidelines I can think of:

1. Monday your hardest workout (but not so hard that you can’t do your workout at Wednesday or even Friday)
2. Wednesday an easier workout
3. Friday a harder workout (as you now have Saturday and occassionally Sunday to recover from)
   
   Perhaps for progressive overload, increase the density e.g. do the same workouts you did last week, but now switch the Friday workout to Wednesday (i.e. 2 hard workouts in a shorter timespan).
   
   And the week after you do 3 hard workouts, the week after again the same workouts but with higher intensity/less rest… etc. (which also increases CTL slowly over time).
   
   In the same trend, you could do the 2-hour endurance ride after your 1-hour scheduled workout to begin with and see how you feel, and progress with doing the 2-hour endurance ride _before_ your 1-hour scheduled workout (i.e. progressive overload by doing it less fresh).
