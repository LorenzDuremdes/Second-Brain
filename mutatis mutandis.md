1. _mutatis mutandis_; used to signal that a proof can be more generally applied to other certain cases after making some, presumably obvious, changes
2. The other cases are sufficiently similar to the one presented that proving them follows by essentially the same logic.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Without_loss_of_generality#cite_note-2] As a result, once a proof is given for the particular case, it is trivial to adapt it to prove the conclusion in all other cases.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Without_loss_of_generality]
