## [[physiology]]
1. why isn't VO<sub>2</sub> max not everything when it comes to road cycling?
	1. it also depends on e.g. pedaling efficiency^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 19]
	2. The two other physiological factors—[[anaerobic threshold|anaerobic threshold]] and [[cycling economy|economy]]—also play a major role in race outcomes. One of these three by itself does not constitute all it takes to race fast. And of course, this doesn’t include other critical race determiners such as strategy, tactics, pacing, nutrition, heat adaptation, and lots more.
2. FTP vs. [[anaerobic threshold]] → road racing + example
	1. for the most part, road race results are greatly dependent on what happens above the [[anaerobic threshold]] e.g. sprinting
	2. Creating or responding to a breakaway in a road race usually means riding at or near aerobic capacity for a few minutes. Race-winning sprints that last only a few seconds are done at about anaerobic capacity, which is well above aerobic capacity. But there are times when the [[anaerobic threshold]] also plays a determining role in the outcome of a road race. For example, a long, steady, high-intensity climb is often done at or near FTP, much as in a [[time trial]]. And once a break is formed, it typically proceeds at around FTP. So having a high FTP is certainly also beneficial for road racing. But for the most part, road race results are greatly dependent on what happens above the [[anaerobic threshold]].

## technique
1. "weakness" vs. "[[limiting factor]]"
	1. For example, an athlete may not be very good at climbing hills. That’s definitely a weakness. But if the most important races of that athlete’s [[season]] are flat criteriums, then this weakness is not a limiter. It’s not standing in the way of [[goal]] success. That’s why limiters are [[goal]]-specific. The concept may be thought of as a mismatch between your weaknesses and the demands of the event for which you are training.^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 19]
2. the smart rider also seeks to employ race tactics in order to get a slight advantage when limiters—even those you’ve improved considerably with training—are challenged^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 19]
	1. if you’re not a great climber, for example, you might start at the front of the pack on a climb and then drift back so that by the top you are still in the group

## [[skeletal muscle]]
1. how to increase your ability to e.g. cycle through a head wind?^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 19]
	1. e.g. legs [[resistance training]]

## tracking performance
### technology
1. self-coached cyclists may need a [[heart rate]] monitor and power meter less
	1. Not all experienced athletes need these tools either, if they are good at sensing how hard they are riding in a workout. They may have an excellent feel for intensity. And if they are self-coached, not having such technology may not hold back their progress significantly.^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 18]
2. what does Joe Friel recommend to measure during a field/clinical test (road cycling)?
	1. FTP and FTHR
		1. functional threshold [[heart rate]] (why?)

# [[sports periodization]]
1. why is "I want to ride faster" a vague [[goal]]?^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 18]
	1. because it depends on e.g. distance
		1. e.g. making it more difficult to measure progress (increasing average required steps)
2. "Christmas stars" (road cycling); riders who are in the best shape of the [[season]] even though it’s only midwinter. By the [[time]] the race [[season]] actually starts, these stars are often burnt out.^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 18 (Joe Friel)]
3. what would be the bottleneck if you had infinite [[time]] (road cycling)?
	1. [[energy]]?

## session
1. should you do a session consisting of Z5 and Z6 intervals (road cycling)? + why^[https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/cycling-power-zones-training-zones-explained/]
	1. probably not due to them not being synergistic e.g. being too tired to do proper Z6 intervals or not getting enough sets (MEV)

## microcycle
1. how could a zone 2 workout not increase fatigue too much despite having a hard session (≥zone 3) previous day?
	1. due to mostly stimulating slower-twitch muscle fibers (which recover more quickly)?
	2. intensity too low to stimulate the longer-to-recover faster-twitch muscle fibers?
	3. going to "[[task failure]]" might also fatigue faster-twitch muscle fibers (which you don't necessarily want due to longer recovery)^[https://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/9v4hlc/slow_twitch_vs_fast_twitch/e99heom?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
	4. **related**
		1. [[Henneman's size principle]]
		2. [[block training]] · [[pre-exhaust training]] → having to do less to (more quickly) stimulate slower-twitch muscle fibers?

## [[mesocycle]]
### [[resistance training]]
1. legs ([[resistance training]]) → MEV → endurance (road cycling)
	1. ◇the first might reduce the 2nd, which can make it easier to cause overload for endurance?
		1. e.g. due to more faster-twitch muscle fibers, bigger muscle fibers...

## macrocycle
1. what does Joe Friel mean with "limiters"?^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 18]
	1. limiting factors (required for e.g. an upcoming race)
		1. e.g. a [[mesocycle]]/block is aimed at targetting specific [[limiting factor]](s)

# miscellaneous
1. what makes road cycling one of the toughest [[sport]]?^[https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/training/cycling-toughest-sport-264258]
	1. “What makes cycling uniquely difficult on a psychological level are the uncontrollable conditions which most other sports don’t have,” says sports psychologist Dr Josephine Perry.

		“The majority of sports are played out in more controlled and routine environments, but cyclists have to contend with weather, spectators, crashes, mechanicals and the constant threat of attacks or missing a potentially race-winning move by another team or rider.”

		Even so, winning in cycling isn’t determined solely by fitness, he points out: “In a rowing race, the best rower in that race will win. In cycling, the rider who has peaked perfectly for a specific race could come last.”

		A similar point was made by Michael Woods, an elite runner turned Cannondale pro, in a previous interview with Cycling Weekly, in which he described having earned a deep respect for the multi-faceted, multi-skilled nature of cycling — that is, compared to distance running, in which, aside from fitness and determination, not much else matters.
