## [[physiology]]
1. why isn't VO<sub>2</sub> max not everything when it comes to road cycling?
	1. it also depends on e.g. pedaling efficiency^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 19]
	2. The two other physiological factors—[[anaerobic capacity|anaerobic threshold]] and [[cycling economy|economy]]—also play a major role in race outcomes. One of these three by itself does not constitute all it takes to race fast. And of course, this doesn’t include other critical race determiners such as strategy, tactics, pacing, nutrition, heat adaptation, and lots more.
2. FTP vs. [[anaerobic capacity]] → road racing + example
	1. for the most part, road race results are greatly dependent on what happens above the [[anaerobic capacity]] e.g. sprinting
	2. Creating or responding to a breakaway in a road race usually means riding at or near aerobic capacity for a few minutes. Race-winning sprints that last only a few seconds are done at about [[anaerobic capacity]], which is well above aerobic capacity. But there are times when the [[anaerobic capacity]] also plays a determining role in the outcome of a road race. For example, a long, steady, high-intensity climb is often done at or near FTP, much as in a [[time trial]]. And once a break is formed, it typically proceeds at around FTP. So having a high FTP is certainly also beneficial for road racing. But for the most part, road race results are greatly dependent on what happens above the [[anaerobic capacity]].
3. higher fitness → [[circulatory system|blood flow]] (sub-maximal exercise) + why
	1. Still in the muscles, as training progresses, the number of [[capillary]] [[blood]] vessels increases, and the size of the smaller veins and arteries increases. The various adaptations in the muscle and the increase in efficiency mean that, as you get fitter, for any given sub-maximal level of exercise the amount of [[blood]] flow required actually goes down because you can produce more power for less [[oxygen]].^[Faster - The Obsession, Science and Luck Behind the World's Fastest Cyclists (by Michael Hutchinson), p. 79]

## technique
1. "weakness" vs. "[[limiting factor]]"
	1. For example, an athlete may not be very good at climbing hills. That’s definitely a weakness. But if the most important races of that athlete’s [[season]] are flat criteriums, then this weakness is not a limiter. It’s not standing in the way of [[goal]] success. That’s why limiters are [[goal]]-specific. The concept may be thought of as a mismatch between your weaknesses and the demands of the event for which you are training.^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 19]
2. the smart rider also seeks to employ race tactics in order to get a slight advantage when limiters—even those you’ve improved considerably with training—are challenged^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 19]
	1. if you’re not a great climber, for example, you might start at the front of the pack on a climb and then drift back so that by the top you are still in the group

## [[skeletal muscle]]
1. how to increase your ability to e.g. cycle through a head wind?^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 19]
	1. e.g. legs [[resistance training]]

## tracking performance
### technology
1. self-coached cyclists may need a [[heart rate]] monitor and power meter less
	1. Not all experienced athletes need these tools either, if they are good at sensing how hard they are riding in a workout. They may have an excellent feel for intensity. And if they are self-coached, not having such technology may not hold back their progress significantly.^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 18]
2. what does Joe Friel recommend to measure during a field/clinical test (road cycling)?
	1. FTP and FTHR
		1. functional threshold [[heart rate]] (why?)

# [[sports periodization]]
1. why is "I want to ride faster" a vague [[goal]]?^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 18]
	1. because it depends on e.g. distance
		1. e.g. making it more difficult to measure progress (increasing average required steps)
2. "Christmas stars" (road cycling); riders who are in the best shape of the [[season]] even though it’s only midwinter. By the [[time]] the race [[season]] actually starts, these stars are often burnt out.^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 18 (Joe Friel)]
3. what would be the bottleneck if you had infinite [[time]] (road cycling)?
	1. [[energy]]?

## session
1. should you do a session consisting of Z5 and Z6 intervals (road cycling)? + why^[https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/cycling-power-zones-training-zones-explained/]
	1. probably not due to them not being synergistic e.g. being too tired to do proper Z6 intervals or not getting enough sets (MEV)

### [[biochemistry]]
1. [[protein]] intra-endurance workout → central fatigue
	1. BCAA consumption during endurance exercise may improve [[time trial]] performance and peak power output while improving markers of immune [[health]] (45) and attenuate [[serotonin]] levels, subsequently resulting in a delay of central fatigue (46)^[[Effects of Protein Supplementation on Performance and Recovery in Resistance and Endurance Training - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6142015/)]

## [[microcycle]]
1. how could a zone 2 workout not increase fatigue too much despite having a hard session (≥zone 3) previous day?
	1. due to mostly stimulating slower-twitch muscle fibers (which recover more quickly)?
	2. intensity too low to stimulate the longer-to-recover faster-twitch muscle fibers?
	3. going to "[[task failure]]" might also fatigue faster-twitch muscle fibers (which you don't necessarily want due to longer recovery)^[https://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/9v4hlc/slow_twitch_vs_fast_twitch/e99heom?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
	4. **related**
		1. [[Henneman's size principle]]
		2. [[block training]] · [[pre-exhaust training]] → having to do less to (more quickly) stimulate slower-twitch muscle fibers?

## [[mesocycle]]
### [[resistance training]]
1. legs ([[resistance training]]) → MEV → endurance (road cycling)
	1. ◇the first might reduce the 2nd, which can make it easier to cause overload for endurance?
		1. e.g. due to more faster-twitch muscle fibers, bigger muscle fibers...

## macrocycle
1. what does Joe Friel mean with "limiters"?^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 18]
	1. limiting factors (required for e.g. an upcoming race)
		1. e.g. a [[mesocycle]]/block is aimed at targetting specific [[limiting factor]](s)

1. what makes road cycling one of the toughest [[sport]]?^[https://www.cyclingweekly.com/fitness/training/cycling-toughest-sport-264258]
	1. “What makes cycling uniquely difficult on a psychological level are the uncontrollable conditions which most other sports don’t have,” says sports psychologist Dr Josephine Perry.

		“The majority of sports are played out in more controlled and routine environments, but cyclists have to contend with weather, spectators, crashes, mechanicals and the constant threat of attacks or missing a potentially race-winning move by another team or rider.”

		Even so, winning in cycling isn’t determined solely by fitness, he points out: “In a rowing race, the best rower in that race will win. In cycling, the rider who has peaked perfectly for a specific race could come last.”

		A similar point was made by Michael Woods, an elite runner turned Cannondale pro, in a previous interview with Cycling Weekly, in which he described having earned a deep respect for the multi-faceted, multi-skilled nature of cycling — that is, compared to distance running, in which, aside from fitness and determination, not much else matters.
	1. Jonas Vingegaard is back riding on his bike outside again^[[Jonas [Vingegaard] is back riding on his bike outside again : r/peloton (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/peloton/comments/1cm9n9k/jonas_vingegaard_is_back_riding_on_his_bike/)]
		1. These guys are fucking lunatics lol. This is great news
		2. Lars Bak had a similar crash on May 29th 2016 with 6 broken ribs, broken shoulder and also broke some things in his back. Pretty sure he punctured a lung too.
		   
		   He completed the Tour that year.
		3. Definitely some of the toughest atheletes if not the toughest of any [[sport]]
		4. I think about this often and rarely bring it up among my friends who aren’t cycling fans because I know they wouldn’t get it and I’m not interested in arguing. But I think cyclists might not only be the toughest/grittiest athletes in the world but that cycling as a [[sport]] (at the professional level) is the most physically and mentally difficult—and I don’t think it’s particularly close.
		   
		   I am blown away every three or four minutes during a race at how insanely hard these guys and gals are riding. As a cyclist myself, it adds a layer of depth of experience to my bewilderment to see what these riders are doing within the context of my own riding.
		   
		   TLDR: cyclists are aliens.

## demography
### STEM
1. Bikes attract tinkerers because it’s a simple machine. Bikes attract data needs because you can track everything. Bikes are as risky as you want to make them which attracts risk averse people that want to get their fix. Bikes are an individual pursuit that can be done in a social setting.
   
   Basically bikes tick a ton of boxes that engineers are looking for.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/q0o53u/comment/hf9jqgq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]

### rich man's [[sport]]
1. Lots of folks saying golf, but I haven’t seen anybody mention cycling. [[Sport]] cycling, not utility cycling to the corner store for a gallon of milk. Mid-level road bikes are now $5000 usd. And it’s pretty common to spend low five-figures on a complete setup.
   
   At least in the Unites States, the average household income of cyclists is quite a bit higher than golfers.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11a6s9b/comment/j9rein0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
