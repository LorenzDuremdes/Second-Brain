## physiology
1. why isn't VO<sub>2</sub> max not everything when it comes to road cycling?
	1. it also depends on e.g. pedaling efficiency^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 19]
	2. The two other physiological factors—[[anaerobic threshold|anaerobic threshold]] and [[cycling economy|economy]]—also play a major role in race outcomes. One of these three by itself does not constitute all it takes to race fast. And of course, this doesn’t include other critical race determiners such as strategy, tactics, pacing, nutrition, heat adaptation, and lots more.
2. FTP vs. [[anaerobic threshold]] → road racing + example
	1. for the most part, road race results are greatly dependent on what happens above the [[anaerobic threshold]] e.g. sprinting
	2. Creating or responding to a breakaway in a road race usually means riding at or near aerobic capacity for a few minutes. Race-winning sprints that last only a few seconds are done at about anaerobic capacity, which is well above aerobic capacity. But there are times when the [[anaerobic threshold]] also plays a determining role in the outcome of a road race. For example, a long, steady, high-intensity climb is often done at or near FTP, much as in a [[time trial]]. And once a break is formed, it typically proceeds at around FTP. So having a high FTP is certainly also beneficial for road racing. But for the most part, road race results are greatly dependent on what happens above the [[anaerobic threshold]].

## technique
1. "weakness" vs. "limiting factor"
	1. For example, an athlete may not be very good at climbing hills. That’s definitely a weakness. But if the most important races of that athlete’s season are flat criteriums, then this weakness is not a limiter. It’s not standing in the way of [[goal]] success. That’s why limiters are [[goal]]-specific. The concept may be thought of as a mismatch between your weaknesses and the demands of the event for which you are training.^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 19]
2. the smart rider also seeks to employ race tactics in order to get a slight advantage when limiters—even those you’ve improved considerably with training—are challenged^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 19]
	1. if you’re not a great climber, for example, you might start at the front of the pack on a climb and then drift back so that by the top you are still in the group

## [[skeletal muscle]]
1. how to increase your ability to e.g. cycle through a head wind?^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 19]
	1. e.g. legs resistance training

## tracking performance
### technology
1. self-coached cyclists may need a heart rate monitor and power meter less
	1. Not all experienced athletes need these tools either, if they are good at sensing how hard they are riding in a workout. They may have an excellent feel for intensity. And if they are self-coached, not having such technology may not hold back their progress significantly.^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 18]
2. what does Joe Friel recommend to measure during a field/clinical test (road cycling)?
	1. FTP and FTHR
		1. functional threshold heart rate (why?)

# [[sports periodization]]
1. why is "I want to ride faster" a vague [[goal]]?^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 18]
	1. because it depends on e.g. distance
		1. e.g. making it more difficult to measure progress (increasing average required steps)
2. "Christmas stars" (road cycling); riders who are in the best shape of the season even though it’s only midwinter. By the time the race season actually starts, these stars are often burnt out.^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 18 (Joe Friel)]

## macrocycle
1. what does Joe Friel mean with "limiters"?^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 18]
	1. limiting factors (required for e.g. an upcoming race)
		1. e.g. a mesocycle/block is aimed at targetting specific limiting factor(s)
