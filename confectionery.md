	1. Fondant has a dense, sugary texture that coats the [[palate]], heightening your sensitivity to subsequent flavors. When followed by a different sweet treat like Tum Tum, the contrast between the two textures and flavors can make the second one seem even more vibrant or intense. The sweetness of fondant might also create a lingering sweetness in your mouth, which can make the following sweet treat feel more satisfying. This kind of pairing works well when the second treat offers a different texture or flavor profile, adding depth to your overall tasting experience.^[ChatGPT]
