# improvements
1. fasted cycling → BMR^[https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/program-body-burn-fat-instead-store-fasted-training/]
	1. the former improves the latter
2. carbohydrate diet → crossover point
	1. athletes with low to moderate carbohydrate nutrition patterns have been shown to use fat at intensities even higher than 65 percent of VO2 max (figure 15.3) and thus preserve their limited stores of carbohydrate. Their bodies are able to mobilize fatty acids as an energy source more efficiently.

		an athlete who consumes a chronically high-carbohydrate diet will tend to be a carbohydrate burner (or sugar burner), see: figure 15.2
