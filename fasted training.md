1. fasted training; completing a workout in a low glycemic state and not consuming any carbohydrates beforehand^[https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/program-body-burn-fat-instead-store-fasted-training/, Chad Timmerman]

# improvements
1. fasted cycling → BMR^[https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/program-body-burn-fat-instead-store-fasted-training/]
	1. the former improves the latter
2. [[carbohydrate]] diet → crossover point
	1. athletes with low to moderate [[carbohydrate]] nutrition patterns have been shown to use [[fat]] at intensities even higher than 65 percent of [[VO2 max]] (figure 15.3) and thus preserve their limited stores of [[carbohydrate]]. Their bodies are able to mobilize fatty acids as an [[energy]] source more efficiently.

		an athlete who consumes a chronically high-[[carbohydrate]] diet will tend to be a [[carbohydrate]] burner (or sugar burner), see: figure 15.2

# how
1. how long to not eat carbohydrates beforehand for "fasted training"?^[https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/program-body-burn-fat-instead-store-fasted-training/]
	1. ≥12 hours
2. how long "fasted training (session)"? + why
	1. until most of your muscle [[glycogen]] is depleted, because you will hit a wall afterward = ~60–90 minutes^[https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/program-body-burn-fat-instead-store-fasted-training/]
2. [[carbohydrate]] restriction pre-workout might matter less (in terms of [[glycogen sparing]]) at higher intensities^[[Optimizing Fat Oxidation Through Exercise and Diet, Juul Achten, PhD, and Asker E. Jeukendrup, PhD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15212756/)]
