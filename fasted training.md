1. fasted training; completing a workout in a low glycemic state and not consuming any carbohydrates beforehand^[https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/program-body-burn-fat-instead-store-fasted-training/, Chad Timmerman]

# improvements
1. fasted cycling → BMR^[https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/program-body-burn-fat-instead-store-fasted-training/]
	1. the former improves the latter
2. [[carbohydrate]] diet → crossover point
	1. athletes with low to moderate [[carbohydrate]] nutrition patterns have been shown to use [[fat]] at intensities even higher than 65 percent of [[VO2 max]] (figure 15.3) and thus preserve their limited stores of [[carbohydrate]]. Their bodies are able to mobilize fatty acids as an [[energy]] source more efficiently.

		an athlete who consumes a chronically high-[[carbohydrate]] diet will tend to be a [[carbohydrate]] burner (or sugar burner), see: figure 15.2

# how
1. how long to not eat carbohydrates beforehand for "fasted training"?^[https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/program-body-burn-fat-instead-store-fasted-training/]
	1. ≥12 hours
2. how long "fasted training (session)"? + why
	1. until most of your muscle [[glycogen]] is depleted, because you will hit a wall afterward = ~60–90 minutes^[https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/program-body-burn-fat-instead-store-fasted-training/], Chad Timmerman
		1. what is a sign that you have depleted most of your [[glycogen]] stores?
			1. smell of ammonia in your breath
	2. how long do you personally like to do fasted training + why
		1. as long as possible while staying within TSS budget (e.g. 60m in the morning followed by a train-high session in the evening) to maximize efficiency (adaptations per TSS)
3. [[carbohydrate]] restriction pre-workout might matter less (in terms of [[glycogen sparing]]) at higher intensities^[[Optimizing Fat Oxidation Through Exercise and Diet, Juul Achten, PhD, and Asker E. Jeukendrup, PhD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15212756/)]

## two-a-days
1. The second way you can implement fasted training into your routine is by doing two-a-days, i.e., completing two workouts in a 24-hour timeframe. If you’re the type of athlete who feels like they can’t get their best high-intensity workouts done in the mornings, this is probably your best option. I know it is for me.
   
   In the mornings, again, before you’ve had anything to eat except for maybe a cup of black coffee, do a soft-pedal workout for about 30 minutes — we recommend the workout Dans for this — to reap the benefits of fasted training. Then, in the afternoons or evenings, complete your higher intensity workouts. If two-a-days sound like something you might like, start by giving it a try three times a week right out of bed and see how you feel.^[[Fasted Cycling: Program Your Body to Burn Fat with Fasted Training - TrainerRoad Blog, Chad Timmerman](https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/program-body-burn-fat-instead-store-fasted-training/)]

# [[physiology]]
1. with fasted training, carbohydrates put a bigger weight on maximizing adaptations post-workout rather than pre-workout for e.g. a race
2. for maximizing fitness adaptations, you might want to minimize [[glycogen sparing]] as opposed to maximizing performance in e.g. racing
	1. From a biochemical perspective, it is well-accepted that reduced muscle [[glycogen]] stores induce greater [[skeletal muscle]] [[cell signaling]] when compared with “matched-work” exercise protocols (i.e., completion of identical duration and intensity) undertaken with high [[glycogen]] stores (Bartlett et al. [2015]). For example, AMPK<sup>Thr172</sup> phosphorylation (Yeo et al. [2010]; Lane et al. [2015]), ACC<sup>Ser79</sup> phosphorylation (Bartlett et al. [2013]), AMPK-*α*2 activity (Wojtaszewski et al. [2003], and the nuclear abundance of AMPK-*α*2 [[protein]] content (Steinberg et al. [2006] are all up-regulated to a greater extent when acute exercise is completed with reduced pre-exercise muscle [[glycogen]] stores, an effect likely mediated via the presence of a [[glycogen]]-binding domain on the _β_-subunit of the AMPK heterotrimer (McBride et al. [2009]). Furthermore, exogenous CHO feeding during exercise attenuates AMPK activity only when muscle [[glycogen sparing]] has occurred (Akerstrom et al. [2006]. The present data extend these findings as we show for the first time comparable [[cell signaling]] effects despite the completion of significantly less work completed. Indeed, although we observed no effects of exercise on AMPK-*α*1 activity (as reported by others, Fuji et al. [2000], we observed similar increases in AMPK-*α*2 activity and PGC-1*α* mRNA expression at comparable levels of absolute [[glycogen]], despite mean differences of 60 min less work completed in LOW + LEU versus HIGH conditions. Such data therefore support the “[[glycogen threshold]]” hypotheses (Philp et al. [2012] surmising that a critical absolute level of [[glycogen]] must be exceeded in order for significant AMPK signaling to occur during prolonged endurance exercise protocols.

# [[evolutionary biology]]
The [[glycogen threshold]] hypothesis in [[endurance training]] posits that low [[glycogen]] levels during training can enhance the training adaptations, particularly in terms of [[mitochondrial biogenesis]] and increased [[lipid metabolism|fat oxidation]]. This is often pursued through strategies like training in a fasted state or conducting a workout after a previous intense session without replenishing carbohydrates, thus keeping [[glycogen]] stores low.

From an evolutionary perspective, the idea that training in a low [[glycogen]] state might induce greater adaptations does have some plausible grounding. Here are several ways in which this hypothesis aligns with evolutionary principles:
1. Survival Mechanisms: Historically, humans often faced situations where [[food]] was scarce, and they still needed to perform physically to hunt or gather [[food]]. Being able to efficiently exercise or perform activities with low [[glycogen]] ([[energy]]) stores would have been advantageous. This could lead to the development of physiological mechanisms that maximize efficiency in [[energy]] usage during low-[[energy]] states.
2. [[Energy]] Conservation and Utilization: Training with low [[glycogen]] stores forces the body to adapt by enhancing its ability to utilize alternative [[energy]] sources, like fats. This is an advantageous trait from an evolutionary perspective, as it allows for sustained [[energy]] release over longer periods, which would be critical for endurance tasks like long hunts or foraging expeditions.
3. Adaptive Responses: The body's adaptive responses to low [[glycogen]] levels, such as increased mitochondrial density and efficiency, can be seen as a form of [[hormesis]], where exposure to low-dose stressors (like low [[energy]] availability) leads to a beneficial increase in [[stress]] resistance. This would have been particularly valuable in unpredictable environments where [[food]] availability could fluctuate drastically.
4. [[Energy]] Efficiency in Lean Times: During times of [[food]] scarcity, individuals with better adaptations to low [[glycogen]] states would arguably have had a selective advantage. These adaptations would not only help in securing [[food]] but also in performing other necessary tasks with limited [[energy]] resources.
5. Cost of Adaptations: While adaptations do require [[energy]] to form and maintain, the evolutionary benefit of being able to survive and reproduce in a low-resource environment likely outweighed these costs. In essence, the [[energy]] cost of developing these adaptations would be a worthwhile investment, providing significant returns during times of scarcity.

Thus, from an evolutionary standpoint, it makes sense that mechanisms which improve performance and efficiency under conditions of low [[glycogen]] availability could have been favored. This does not necessarily imply that training in a [[glycogen]]-depleted state is optimal for modern athletes in all circumstances, as the demands and conditions faced today are different from those in ancient times. Modern athletes need to balance the potential benefits of such adaptations with the risks of [[overtraining]] and the needs for recovery and performance in their specific sports.^[GPT-4]
