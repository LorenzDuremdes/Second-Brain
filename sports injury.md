1. Starting each meso at the [[minimum effective volume (MEV)]] for [[hypertrophy]] has big upsides. First, starting with lower volumes can reduce the volume jump from the preceding deload week, reducing the chance of injury from rapid escalations in volume. Second, training at MEV means you make gains in muscle, but at the smallest costs of both injury risk and fatigue accumulation.^[[Optimizing Hypertrophy: The Case for Increasing Sets in Mesocycles â€“ RP Strength](https://rpstrength.com/blogs/articles/in-defense-of-set-increases-within-the-hypertrophy-mesocycle)]
