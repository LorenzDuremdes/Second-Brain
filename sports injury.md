1. Sustaining an injury increases the risk of a subsequent injury of any type, not just a recurrence of the original injury. This indicates that alterations from previous injuries might overload structures other than those directly involved in the initial injury.^[[Training Load and Its Role in Injury Prevention, Part I: Back to the Future - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7534945/)]
# prevention
1. Starting each meso at the [[minimum effective volume (MEV)]] for [[hypertrophy]] has big upsides. First, starting with lower volumes can reduce the volume jump from the preceding deload week, reducing the chance of injury from rapid escalations in volume. Second, training at MEV means you make gains in muscle, but at the smallest costs of both injury risk and fatigue accumulation.^[[Optimizing Hypertrophy: The Case for Increasing Sets in Mesocycles â€“ RP Strength](https://rpstrength.com/blogs/articles/in-defense-of-set-increases-within-the-hypertrophy-mesocycle)]

# rehabilitation
1. how can training load metrics help in recovery when it doesn't really cause/predict injury?
	1. although current TL metrics cannot provide meaningful [[information]] on whether the load progression increases the injury risk by excessively loading a particular structure, they can assist in setting targets that an athlete must tolerate to successfully return to [[sport]] postinjury (when sufficient historical TL records are available)^[[Training Load and Its Role in Injury Prevention, Part I: Back to the Future - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7534945/)]
