1. socioeconomic status; an economic and sociological combined total measure of a person's work experience and of an individual's or [[family]]'s access to economic resources and social position in relation to others.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status#cite_note-1]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status#cite_note-ReferenceA-2]

# [[upper class]]
## [[personality]]
1. Wealthy individuals are generally quite charismatic, articulate, and well-versed on any given topic. I’ve noticed they can talk to anyone and everyone, irrespective of age, gender, or socioeconomic background, and be able to relate and engage their interlocutor in ways most cannot. It makes sense, as money generally brings [[confidence]] and they have the means to be well-educated and open minded.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t9g5it/comment/hzuzvhd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]

### appearance
1. They look naturally healthy and fit.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1abur4l/comment/kjrsket/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]
2. No logos on their clothes, but very well-fitted (tailored) and pressed/cleaned.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t9g5it/comment/hzu074h/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]

### 'difficulties'
1. Speaking about your plans for your life with full expectations that they will be successful no matter how unrealistic they would be to the rest of us.
   
   "I plan to become a writer, but in the meantime I'm thinking of opening my own art gallery. I'll totally be successful, all my wealthy friends will buy shit from me, then I'll hire someone to run things while I travel for the experience I'll need to do my writing."^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t9g5it/comment/hztzu1m/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]
	2. perhaps the biggest but most subtle indicator—how they think. One thing I’ve noticed about the wealthy is their “can-do” mindset. Money can, for the most part, fix any problem. There’s virtually no problem one can’t solve without drowning it in money. This mentality seeps through many aspects of their life and it shows. Hence, why they perpetually seem to have a positive outlook, and are unbothered by trivial things. They’re easy going, they’re fun to be around, they’re generous, well-spoken, creative, and more concerned with the bigger picture.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t9g5it/comment/hzuzvhd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]
2. And there's a zen to their reaction to (for them) minor inconveniences, but (for most) a bust in the budget. Like breaking a laptop or needing a hotel for an extra night.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1abur4l/comment/kjr0jpv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]
	1. The main difference between people with money and people without money is how they react to money-related emergencies.
	   
	   If your bike got stolen, a poor person will understand how much of a problem this can be for you, because poor people understand a bicycle to be your method of transportation that you need to run errands and perhaps sustain your ability to work, which in turn sustains your life. They may also understand that it's difficult for you to replace the bike. A well-to-do person would say "ah well, why don't you just buy a new bike?" because, to them, a bicycle is just a fun exercise toy that is non-essential (they probably have a car) and is easy to replace.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11w1vhx/comment/jcwxg1t/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]
3. They have no hesitation in replacing a broken item instead of trying to fix it.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1abur4l/comment/kjr4dys/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]

### spending money
1. Owning a second house or a boat and not feeling obligated to use it heavily.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t9g5it/comment/hzu7cys/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]
2. Not hesitating to eat in a restaurant with no prices on the menu.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t9g5it/comment/hzur5p8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]
3. One of my roommates child-hood friends has generational wealth, billionaire level. They lived on the Big Island of Hawaii and she would remark that he would just decide to go skiing, in Aspen on a whim, and wonder aloud why everyone else didn't just drop everything and go the next day. The guy was super down to earth but a bit disconnected from the reality of his friends living paycheck to paycheck.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t9g5it/comment/hzw6fsf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]
4. If they need help, they do so with an attitude of “I have money, you have something I want, let’s finish this transaction quickly”.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11w1vhx/comment/jcz353m/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]

## buying [[time]]
1. If you use money to get [[time]] instead of [[time]] to get money^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t9g5it/comment/hzvysrr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]
2. Rich people buy [[time]]. If you have more than enough money - [[time]] becomes the valuable thing. Why waste hours doing something you don't want to do if you have plenty of money and somebody else can do it.
   
   We deliver to a yacht club. Boats that cost more than my house - 10 times more some of them. One year a guys boat had a blown engine or something and they couldn't get a new engine for like 6 months (after the summer was over). But the manufacturer had a new boat he could buy just like his. 10 million. He said could you do the extras like mine had and get it ready in a month they said 2 million more he said yes. So he bought another 12 million dollar boat instead of waiting for the old 12 million dollar one to be fixed. I asked him why we would spend all that money and not just wait. He just looked me dead in the eye and said I'm 60 years old, I have about 15 summers left before I die. Maybe 10 before my [[health]] might decline and I can't be on my boat anymore. I don't care about money anymore I have 100 times the money to live those 15 summers and I can always make more money - but I can't make more summers. I don't want to miss one one of my last 10 summers, I want to keep my plans.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1cu4lnt/comment/l4gw25v/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]
3. Not worrying about losing a job and just taking up a [[hobby]] because they have “[[time]] to kill” instead of looking for a job that helps pays bills.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t9g5it/comment/hzuqnt5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]

## house
1. Minimalist homes. I don't know why...but rich people like the simple asthetic which honestly doesn't feel homey. They'd rather live with very few things.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11w1vhx/comment/jcwne8p/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]
