## buying [[time]]
1. Rich people buy [[time]]. If you have more than enough money - [[time]] becomes the valuable thing. Why waste hours doing something you don't want to do if you have plenty of money and somebody else can do it.
   
   We deliver to a yacht club. Boats that cost more than my house - 10 times more some of them. One year a guys boat had a blown engine or something and they couldn't get a new engine for like 6 months (after the summer was over). But the manufacturer had a new boat he could buy just like his. 10 million. He said could you do the extras like mine had and get it ready in a month they said 2 million more he said yes. So he bought another 12 million dollar boat instead of waiting for the old 12 million dollar one to be fixed. I asked him why we would spend all that money and not just wait. He just looked me dead in the eye and said I'm 60 years old, I have about 15 summers left before I die. Maybe 10 before my [[health]] might decline and I can't be on my boat anymore. I don't care about money anymore I have 100 times the money to live those 15 summers and I can always make more money - but I can't make more summers. I don't want to miss one one of my last 10 summers, I want to keep my plans.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1cu4lnt/comment/l4gw25v/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]
