	1. Bids are often purposely subtle because people are afraid to be vulnerable and put themselves out there. It’s scary to say, “Hey! I want to connect! Pay attention to me!” so instead, we ask a question or tell a story or offer our hand for connection. We hope we’ll receive connection in return, but if not, it’s less scary than pleading, “Connect with me, please!”

	1. ◇diminishing returns
		1. ~80% global optimum? (**related**: SRS retention%)
		2. too low and you don't feel listened/wasting a lot of time and energy

		1. The first eight items form the responsiveness scale, and the second eight items form the insensitivity scale. The **average responsiveness score** was slightly over 3.5 with most scores falling between 2.4 and 4.7, and the **average insensitivity score** was just under 1, with most people scoring between 0 and 2. There were gender differences with men having lower overall scores, but only by a fraction of a point.
