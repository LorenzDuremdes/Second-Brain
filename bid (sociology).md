Pay attention to me!” so instead, we ask a question or tell a story or offer our hand for connection. We hope we’ll receive connection in return, but if not, it’s less scary than pleading, “Connect with me, please!”

		1. ~80% global optimum? (**related**: SRS retention%)

		1. The first eight items form the responsiveness scale, and the second eight items form the insensitivity scale. The **average responsiveness score** was slightly over 3.5 with most scores falling between 2.4 and 4.7, and the **average insensitivity score** was just under 1, with most people scoring between 0 and 2. There were gender differences with men having lower overall scores, but only by a fraction of a point.
