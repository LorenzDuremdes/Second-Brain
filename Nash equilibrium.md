1. what is the Nash equilibrium of "rock-paper-scissors" + why?
	1. choose one of the eponymous hand gestures completely at random, each roughly a third of the time, because if we tried playing, say, more rock, our opponent would quickly notice and start playing more paper, which would make us play more scissors, and so forth until we both settled into the 1⁄3 - 1⁄3 - 1⁄3 equilibrium again^[Algorithms to Live By The Computer Science of Human Decisions by Brian Christian, Tom Griffiths, p. 188]
