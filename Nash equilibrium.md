1. what is the Nash equilibrium of "rock-paper-scissors" + why?
	1. choose one of the eponymous hand gestures completely at random, each roughly a third of the time, because if we tried playing, say, more rock, our opponent would quickly notice and start playing more paper, which would make us play more scissors, and so forth until we both settled into the 1⁄3 - 1⁄3 - 1⁄3 equilibrium again^[Algorithms to Live By The Computer Science of Human Decisions by Brian Christian, Tom Griffiths, p. 188]
2. Nash equilibria are intractable^[Algorithms to Live By The Computer Science of Human Decisions by Brian Christian, Tom Griffiths, p. 189]

1. how can one maximin Nash equilibrium?
	1. via positive [[minimax]] (worsening it for everyone involved) → it might shift the Nash equilibrium to something more positive
		1. ...But they might be able to act as their own don by signing a legally binding contract to the effect that, say, any proceeds earned by either shop on a Sunday go to the other shop. By worsening the unsatisfactory equilibrium, they’d make a new and better one...^[Algorithms to Live By The Computer Science of Human Decisions by Brian Christian, Tom Griffiths, p. 193]
