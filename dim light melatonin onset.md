1. The results of the present study are consistent with those of Gordijn et al. (1999), who found that, in healthy individuals, the [[melatonin]] [[circadian rhythm|rhythm]] was closely associated with the [[sleep]]–wake cycle such that the average [[time]] of DLMO was later if the scheduled [[sleep]] [[time]] occurred later.
   
   [[Sleep]] onset [[time]] during the scheduled [[sleep]] differed between groups by 1 h 50 min and DLMO differed by a similar amount – 1 h 43 min – as expected, given that the phase angle of entrainment to the light–dark cycle (Daan and Pittendrigh, 1976) is gated by the wake–[[sleep]] pattern, respectively, in humans (Dijk and Lockley, 2002).^[[Timing of Sleep and Its Relationship with the Endogenous Melatonin Rhythm - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3008942/)]
