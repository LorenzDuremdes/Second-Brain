1. why do you like stack your hands (TT bike)?
	1. One thought from another rider is that the stacked hands may also change the way a rider shrugs their shoulders. So the hands themselves make a small difference but if it allows you to turtle your shoulders it can improve your aerodynamics
	   
	   - It's all about reducing frontal area. Moving or rotating your hands will effect your forearms, upper arms, and shoulders.
	   - You want the hand position that brings your shoulders most narrow while still maintaining the ability to hold your position. Stacking hands isn't typically about airflow over or around the hands as much as it's about narrowing the shoulders. Shoulders are the big aero killer for many triathletes.
	   - As previously mentioned, you want the ability to get your head low, and there are certain hands positions for some that work better than others.^[[Hand positioning on aero bars: Triathlon Forum: Slowtwitch Forums](https://forum.slowtwitch.com/forum/Slowtwitch_Forums_C1/Triathlon_Forum_F1/Hand_positioning_on_aero_bars_P6344614/)]
