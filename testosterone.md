1. at what age does testosterone decrease?
	1. ~40
		1. ~1% decrease per year^[https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/testosterone_aging_and_the_mind]
2. testosterone → [[pain tolerance]]
	1. The testosterone surge of [[male]] puberty also stimulates the production of [[red blood cell|red blood cells]], so men can use more [[oxygen]] than [[women]], and it makes [[men]] less sensitive to pain than women—just as it does to both animals and people who are given testosterone injections.^[The Sports Gene: Inside the Science of Extraordinary Athletic Performance, p. 70–71]
## [[men]]
3. [[men]] who watch a sexually explicit movie have an average increase of 35% in testosterone, peaking at 60–90 minutes after the end of the film, but no increase is seen in [[men]] who watch sexually neutral films.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone#cite_note-48]

	They did an incredible study on birds looking at this.

	It was known that birds with more colorful feathers had higher testosterone.

	The crazy thing was that when they artificially colored the feathers of the low testosterone birds. Those birds testosterone levels dramatically increased to match the color !

	Changing the color of the feathers led to a physiological change !
