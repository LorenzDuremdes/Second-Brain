# bubble universes
1. how could "bubble universes" have different laws of physics despite 'expanding from a single point'?
	1. during the rapid expansion of the universe in the early moments of inflation, quantum fluctuations can lead to variations in the values of fundamental constants and properties^[GPT-3.5]^[The Big Picture On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself (Carroll, Sean M), p. ~323]
		1. Quantum fluctuations are inherent to the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics, which states that at the microscopic scale, there's an inherent limit to how precisely we can know certain pairs of properties, like position and momentum, energy and time, or even some fundamental constants. This uncertainty leads to temporary, unpredictable fluctuations in these properties.
