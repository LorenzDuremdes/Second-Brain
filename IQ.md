1. IQ · level of [[measurement]]
	1. interval scale → it doesn't have a non-arbitrary zero point
	2. ¬"[[ordinal scale]]", because it has numbers/quantity ∴ allows for degree of difference
# testing
## static ↮ dynamic
1. static IQ test; they test an individual’s [[knowledge]] and ability to solve one-off problems they do not directly measure the ability to learn and adapt over time^[Universal [[Intelligence]]: A [[Definition]] of Machine [[Intelligence]], p. 9]

	merely focusing on what a child can achieve without any help (static)
	
	dynamic testing is a method that enables measuring and unfolding of the learning potential within a short time frame^[https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/research/research-projects/social-and-behavioural-sciences/intelligence-dynamic-testing-and-potential-for-learning]

## Wechsler Adult [[Intelligence]] Scale
1. why did David Wechsler add both verbal and nonverbal components of an IQ test?^[Universal [[Intelligence]]: A [[Definition]] of Machine [[Intelligence]], p. 6]
	1. David Wechsler believed that the original Binet tests were too focused on verbal skills and thus disadvantaged certain otherwise intelligent individuals, for example the deaf or people who did not speak the test [[language]] as a first [[language]].

## Raven's Progressive Matrices
1. Raven's Progressive Matrices; a nonverbal test typically used to measure general [[human]] [[intelligence]] and abstract reasoning and is regarded as a non-verbal estimate of fluid [[intelligence]].^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices#cite_note-1]

## computer science
1. how could IQ not be as meaningful to test machine performance?^[Universal [[Intelligence]]: A [[Definition]] of Machine [[Intelligence]], p. 7]
	1. the distribution of machine performance would be continually changing due to advancing technology. Thus, for our purposes, an absolute measure will be more meaningful than a traditional IQ type of measure

# genetics ↮ environment
1. are "adoptive parents" a "random sample" for e.g. estimating influence of "genetics ↮ environment" on IQ? + why^[https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/pmds85/comment/hchwt1s/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
	1. no, they are highly screened and middle class or affluent. These kids are getting better quality care than average. This doesn’t mean there is no effect from the family they’re in - these families are similar to each other in crucial ways.
