1. notalgia paresthetica; a chronic [[somatosensory system|sensory]] [[peripheral neuropathy|neuropathy]]. A common localized itch, affecting mainly the area between the shoulder blades (especially the T2â€“T6 dermatomes) but occasionally with a more widespread distribution, involving the shoulders, back, and upper chest.
   
   The causes of this condition have not yet been completely defined. Patients are usually older persons.
   
   The correlation of notalgia paresthetica localization with corresponding degenerative changes in the spine suggests that [[spinal nerve]] impingement may be a contributing cause.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notalgia_paresthetica]
