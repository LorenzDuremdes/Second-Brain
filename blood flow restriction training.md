1. Hypothetical schematic diagram of the potential for [[blood]] flow restriction (BFR) to augment the molecular signals and associated physiological adaptations with repeated bouts of exercise training.

	‘mRNA response’ represents the acute transcriptional response to single exercise sessions. 
	
	‘Protein response’ represents changes in protein content and/or function (or post-translational modification).

	‘Adaptation’ represents changes in physiological properties associated with [[capillary]] growth and [[mitochondrial biogenesis]] (mitochondrial content and respiratory function).

	Black and red lines represent the magnitude and timing of training-induced adaptation in non-BFR conditions (based on Granata et al., 2018) and BFR conditions, respectively^[https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/EP089280]

# [[aerobic exercise]]
1. The direct measurement of free radical generation and [[redox]] markers confirmed systemic increases in ROS following BFR exercise sessions^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9952836/#B18-antioxidants-12-00501]^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9952836/#B19-antioxidants-12-00501]. Such a profound rise in ROS/RNS, associated with local reactive hyperemia, might contribute to increases in muscle mass, strength, and performance^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9952836/#B20-antioxidants-12-00501].
	1. Moreover, a six-week BFR training program was shown to accentuate beneficial ROS-mediated improvements in performance. BFR training resulted in an increase in peak aerobic power output in accordance with the improved redox status determined by an elevated GSH/GSSG ratio^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9952836/#B89-antioxidants-12-00501]

# rehabilitation
1. Blood flow restriction training can be used to augment strength and [[hypertrophy]] gains during the early phases of rehabilitation, when higher loads may not be tolerated by the patient.
   
   Evidence suggests that blood flow restriction training can improve function and pain outcomes beyond traditional [[resistance training]] in individuals with joint injuries.^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8448465/]
