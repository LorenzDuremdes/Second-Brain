1. Hypothetical schematic diagram of the potential for [[blood]] flow restriction (BFR) to augment the molecular signals and associated physiological adaptations with repeated bouts of exercise training.

	‘mRNA response’ represents the acute transcriptional response to single exercise sessions. 
	
	‘Protein response’ represents changes in protein content and/or function (or post-translational modification).

	‘Adaptation’ represents changes in physiological properties associated with [[capillary]] growth and [[mitochondrial biogenesis]] (mitochondrial content and respiratory function).

	Black and red lines represent the magnitude and timing of training-induced adaptation in non-BFR conditions (based on Granata et al., 2018) and BFR conditions, respectively^[https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/EP089280]

# [[aerobic exercise]]
## [[physiology]]
1. The direct measurement of free radical generation and [[redox]] markers confirmed systemic increases in ROS following BFR exercise sessions^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9952836/#B18-antioxidants-12-00501]^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9952836/#B19-antioxidants-12-00501]. Such a profound rise in ROS/RNS, associated with local reactive hyperemia, might contribute to increases in muscle mass, strength, and performance^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9952836/#B20-antioxidants-12-00501].
	1. Moreover, a six-week BFR training program was shown to accentuate beneficial ROS-mediated improvements in performance. BFR training resulted in an increase in peak aerobic power output in accordance with the improved [[redox]] status determined by an elevated GSH/GSSG ratio^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9952836/#B89-antioxidants-12-00501]
2. BFR training sessions are/feel more intense than hard training sessions without BFR
   
   Because BFR is uncomfortable, practicing it consistently increases your tolerance to dealing with discomfort. Legs on fire cranking up Heaven’s Gate Hill? No big deal: you feel more muscle burn during any given BFR session.^[[Blood Flow Restriction Training | Benefits of BFR Training (bicycling.com)](https://www.bicycling.com/training/a37980332/blood-flow-restriction-training/)]

## [[sports science]]
1. BFR60 vs. BFR80
   
   Cycling with BFR increased metabolic stress, decreased [[blood]] flow, and impaired neuromuscular function. However, only BFR60 did so without causing very severe pain (>8 on pain intensity scale). Cycling with BFR at moderate pressure may serve as a potential alternative to traditional high-intensity [[aerobic exercise]].
   
   Pre- to post-exercise changes in knee extensor function were also assessed. BFR60 and BFR80 reduced [[blood]] flow (~33 and ~ 50%, respectively) and tissue saturation index (~5 and ~15%, respectively) when compared to LL (all p < 0.05). BFR60 resulted in lower VO2, [[heart rate]], ventilation, and perceived exertion compared to HL (all p < 0.05), whereas BFR80 resulted in similar heart rates and exertion to HL (both p > 0.05). BFR60 and BFR80 elicited greater pain compared to LL and HL (all p < 0.05). After exercise, knee extensor torque decreased by ~18 and 40% for BFR60 and BFR80, respectively (both p < 0.05), and was compromised mostly through peripheral mechanisms. Cycling with BFR increased metabolic stress, decreased [[blood]] flow, and impaired [[central nervous system fatigue|neuromuscular function]].^[[Frontiers | Physiological Responses to Acute Cycling With Blood Flow Restriction (frontiersin.org)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2022.800155/full)]
   
   > BFR80 might not be any more beneficial than high-load cycling e.g. the latter reduces blood flow as well (like RT)?
