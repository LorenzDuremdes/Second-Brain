1. Hypothetical schematic diagram of the potential for [[blood]] flow restriction (BFR) to augment the molecular signals and associated physiological adaptations with repeated bouts of exercise training.

	‘mRNA response’ represents the acute transcriptional response to single exercise sessions. 
	
	‘Protein response’ represents changes in protein content and/or function (or post-translational modification).

	‘Adaptation’ represents changes in physiological properties associated with [[capillary]] growth and [[mitochondrial biogenesis]] (mitochondrial content and respiratory function).

	Black and red lines represent the magnitude and timing of training-induced adaptation in non-BFR conditions (based on Granata et al., 2018) and BFR conditions, respectively^[https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/EP089280]

1. The direct measurement of free radical generation and [[redox]] markers confirmed systemic increases in ROS following BFR exercise sessions^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9952836/#B18-antioxidants-12-00501]^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9952836/#B19-antioxidants-12-00501]. Such a profound rise in ROS/RNS, associated with local reactive hyperemia, might contribute to increases in muscle mass, strength, and performance^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9952836/#B20-antioxidants-12-00501].
