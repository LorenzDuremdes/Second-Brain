1. {sitting still ↮ moving} → [[cognitive load]]
	1. sitting still increases [[cognitive load]]^[The Extended Mind: The Power of Thinking Outside the Brain, p. 52]
2. [[hypofrontality]] can be advantageous e.g. after high-intensity exercise → diffuse mode^[The Extended Mind: The Power of Thinking Outside the Brain, p. 57]
2. embodied [[cognition]] → cognitive biases
	1. the former can be used to reduce the latter e.g. you personally feel a bit more 'alert' when your psychological defense mechanisms are raised^[The Extended Mind: The Power of Thinking Outside the Brain, p. 39]

# technology
## positives
1. larger high-resolution displays → embodied cognition
	1. the former enhances the latter as they allow users to engage their "physical embodied resources" like peripheral vision and spatial memory^[GPT-4]^[The Extended Mind_ The Power of Thinking Outside the Brain, p. ~140]
