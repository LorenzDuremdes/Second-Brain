1. Just like for Odeur 53, the main characteristic of this fragrance is absolutely [[avant-garde]] structure, or its absence, as each component has its own life. Odeur 71 components are really \'nuclear\': the smell of dust on red-hot bulb, the smell of hot metal, the smell of freshly toasted bread, ink, electric batteries, and other inorganic smells of the Earth. Inorganic odors of the Earth chaos live in this [[perfume]] together with some rare natural organic components: incense, bay leaf, bamboo, and white pepper. After the above presented the conclusion follows: not at all ordinary fragrance for aliens who want to get to know our planet olfactory. It was launched in 2000.^[https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Comme-des-Garcons/Odeur-71-396.html]
2. This [[perfume]] is probably the only one that I own that uses some Natural accords trying to recreate a [[perfume]] entirely inorganic, in-concept
3. Doesn't smell like anything from the natural world. Smells of a variety of plastic types.
4. Oduer 71 is an ethereal [[avant-garde]] fragrance that is (almost) ineffable. When words cannot directly describe a sensation, we can either apophatically or analogously paint a picture aptly representing our experience.
