1. which color absorbs the most heat + why?
	1. Near infrared light -- just out of range to the [[human]] eye -- makes up a significant portion of the radiant [[energy]] that reaches Earth's surface. And examining that light, the researchers found that not black but **dark green** absorbed the most infrared, at 87%. Black absorbed 86% of the infrared that struck it, while white proved the least absorptive, at 63%.

From left, the nine colors are red, white, blue, dark green, gray, black, purple, yellow, and green.^[[Worse than black?
