1. stretching → muscle fiber type
	1. stretching might cause a shift toward the more [[slow-twitch muscle fibers type I|oxidative type]]^[https://www.instagram.com/p/CKvkyWHgioV/]
2. muscle fiber type dominance → [[heart]] rate ([[aerobic exercise]])^[https://youtu.be/BPBFmrFQ0Js?t=6740]
	1. if you are genetically more fast-twitch dominant, you tend to have a higher [[heart]] rate during [[aerobic exercise]]

# muscle fiber types
1. [[slow-twitch muscle fibers type I]]
2. [[fast-twitch muscle fibers type II]]
3. human muscle tends to be a lot more heterogenous compared to other animals^[https://youtu.be/fbpzG7eVKY0?t=3540, Muscle Fiber Composition, Pro Cyclist Data, Crashing and More – Ask a Cycling Coach 316]

# endurance
1. fiber size ↔ endurance
	1. the bigger, the less endurance^[https://youtu.be/fbpzG7eVKY0?t=3420, Muscle Fiber Composition, Pro Cyclist Data, Crashing and More – Ask a Cycling Coach 316]
	2. **related**: [[Henneman's size principle]]

# [[muscle protein synthesis]]
1. fiber oxidative capacity ↔ [[muscle protein synthesis]]
	1. fibers with a higher oxidative capacity possess a higher potential for MPS (yet remain paradoxically relatively small to faster-twitch muscle fibers)^[https://youtu.be/fbpzG7eVKY0?t=3440, Muscle Fiber Composition, Pro Cyclist Data, Crashing and More – Ask a Cycling Coach 316]

# fiber type interconversion
1. how does it make sense that there's an interconversion of slower- to faster-twitch muscle fibers due to inactivity?
	1. absence of endurance work^[https://youtu.be/fbpzG7eVKY0?t=4600, Muscle Fiber Composition, Pro Cyclist Data, Crashing and More – Ask a Cycling Coach 316]
