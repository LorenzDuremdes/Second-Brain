1. space-[[time]] tradeoff ([[computer science]]); a case where an [[algorithm]] or program trades increased space usage with decreased [[time]]
	1. e.g. data compression
2. The utility of a given space–[[time]] tradeoff is affected by related fixed and variable costs (of, e.g., CPU speed, storage space), and is subject to **[[diminishing returns]]**.
	1. why? → increased [[time]]/[[computational complexity]]

	1. [[floating-point arithmetic]] compresses (approximates) to save space + "precision" (former) is related to "[[time]]" (latter)
