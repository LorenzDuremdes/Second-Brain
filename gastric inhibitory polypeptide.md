1. gastric inhibitory polypeptide; an inhibiting [[hormone]] of the secretin family of hormones. While it is a weak inhibitor of [[gastric acid]] secretion, its main role, being an incretin, is to stimulate insulin secretion.
   
   It has traditionally been named gastrointestinal inhibitory peptide or gastric inhibitory peptide and was found to decrease the secretion of stomach acid to protect the small intestine from acid damage, reduce the rate at which [[food]] is transferred through the stomach, and inhibit the GI motility and secretion of acid. However, this is incorrect, as it was discovered that these effects are achieved only with higher-than-normal physiological level, and that these results naturally occur in the body through a similar [[hormone]], secretin.
   
   It is now believed that the function of GIP is to induce insulin secretion, which is stimulated primarily by hyperosmolarity of [[glucose]] in the duodenum. After this discovery, some researchers prefer the new name of [[glucose]]-dependent insulinotropic peptide, while retaining the acronym "GIP." The amount of insulin secreted is greater when [[glucose]] is administered orally than intravenously.^[[Gastric inhibitory polypeptide - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_inhibitory_polypeptide)]
