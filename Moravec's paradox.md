1. Moravec's paradox; the observation by artificial [[intelligence]] and robotics researchers that, contrary to traditional assumptions, reasoning requires very little computation, but sensorimotor skills require enormous [[computational complexity|computational resources]]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec's_paradox]

# example
1. The main lesson of thirty-five years of AI research is that the **hard problems are easy and the easy problems are hard**. The mental abilities of a four-year-old that we take for granted – recognizing a face, lifting a pencil, walking across a room, answering a question – in fact solve some of the hardest engineering problems ever conceived... As the new generation of intelligent devices appears, it will be the [[stock]] analysts and petrochemical engineers and parole board members who are in danger of being replaced by machines. The gardeners, receptionists, and cooks are secure in their jobs for decades to come.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPinker2007190–91-10]
