	1. yes, especially drama therapy
		1. e.g. theater gave him a chance to deeply and physically experience what it was like to be someone other than the learning-disabled, oversensitive boy that he had gradually become

## [[psychotherapy]]
1. which members of the group had benefited from psychological trauma therapy and which had continued to feel suicidal and [[self]]-destructive?^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 171]
	1. our TAQ interviews provided some answers. The patients who remained [[self]]-destructive had told us that they did not remember [[feeling]] safe with anybody as a child; they had reported being abandoned, shuttled from place to place, and generally left to their own devices

		I concluded that, if you carry a [[memory]] of having felt safe with somebody long ago, the traces of that earlier affection can be reactivated in attuned relationships when you are an adult, whether these occur in daily life or in good therapy. However, if you lack a deep [[memory]] of [[feeling]] loved and safe, the receptors in the [[brain]] that respond to [[human]] kindness may simply fail to develop.
		
		This notion found further support in the work of the neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp, who found that young rats that were not licked by their moms during the first week of their lives did not develop opioid receptors in the anterior [[cingulate cortex]], a part of the [[brain]] associated with affiliation and a sense of safety.^[See E. E. Nelson and J. Panksepp, “[[Brain]] Substrates of [[Infant]] Mother Attachment: Contributions of Opioids, [[Oxytocin]], and [[Norepinephrine]],” [[Neuroscience]] & Biobehavioral Reviews 22, no. 3 (1998): 437–52.

1. psychological trauma (chameleon analogy)^[Alok Kanojia, Wednesday 23/06/2021]
	1. trauma tends to "disguise" itself as other mental illnesses (e.g. [[depression]], anxiety) fixing e.g. [[depression]] brings [[anxiety disorder]], which brings something else once 'cured'
	2. *I didnt even know about cptsd and, for such a long [[time]], tried to tackle my anxiety and [[depression]] instead. I really thought I was creating my own problems subconsciously. While that might hold some truth, I am making leaps of progress just by understanding my cptsd and how it changed my [[brain]].*^[https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/o6kkkx/if_you_said_to_someone_my_parents_broke_my/h2tdrqb?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
2. what could be better than saying things like "You are good enough"?^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 334]
	1. teaching them (catalyzing) how to feel good enough
		1. instead of giving fish, teaching them to fish
		2. how? e.g. letting them experience things like your acceptance of them?
3. can you process psychological trauma if it overwhelms you?^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 260]
	1. probably not
		1. why? e.g. lack of positive replacement

### [[flooding (psychology)]]
1. how long does "[[flooding (psychology)]]" have to take place for it to reduce psychological trauma anxiety?^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 258]^[T. M. Keane, “The Role of [[Exposure Therapy]] in the Psychological Treatment of PTSD,” National Center for PTSD Clinical Quarterly 5, no. 4 (1995): 1–6.]
	1. ~100 minutes

### [[focusing (psychotherapy)]]
1. is Bessel van der Kolk fond of "[[focusing (psychotherapy)]]"? + why^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 278]
	1. yes, because the rational and emotional [[brain]] can have different perspectives/reactions on the same psychological traumas

### [[eye movement desensitization and reprocessing]]
1. EMDR → adults with histories of childhood trauma ↮ adults with trauma during adulthood^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 297]
	1. at the end of eight weeks, almost half of the adult-onset group that received EMDR scored as completely cured, while only 9 percent of the child-abuse group showed such pronounced improvement

## [[developmental psychopathology]]
1. psychological trauma is mostly nature **and** nurture (still inconclusive)^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 186]
	1. even parents with their own genetic vulnerabilities can pass on that protection to the next generation **provided that they are given the right support**
### puberty
1. psychological trauma → puberty ([[autism]] analogy)
	1. ◇things might unfold in a lot more domains (e.g. romance, **see**: [[attachment style]]) that weren't (as) visible before during puberty?
	2. **analog**: lack of synaptic pruning ([[autism]]) · higher cognitive functions (ontogenesis) → ◇easier [[information]] overload
2. sexually abused girls tend to develop puberty earlier^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 195]
	1. why? due to e.g. higher [[testosterone]] and androstenedione^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 197] (why?)

### treatment
1. does Bessel van der Kolk think it's important that he knows every detail of a patient's trauma? + why^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 148]^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 153]
	1. no, he thinks it's critical that the patients themselves learn to tolerate [[feeling]] what they feel and knowing what they know
	2. you may realize that your fear of intimacy has something to do with your mother’s postpartum [[depression]] or with the fact that she herself was molested as a child, but that alone is unlikely to open you to happy, trusting engagement with others

## [[developmental psychology]]
1. consistent ↮ erratic caregiving → [[self]]-regulation (kids)^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 194]
	1. the children who received consistent caregiving became well-regulated kids, while erratic caregiving produced kids who were chronically physiologically aroused (e.g. anxious)
	2. e.g. [[autism]] can cause the kid to be more likely to see their (neurotypical) caregiving as erratic?

## [[psychosomatic]]
1. how can there be a mismatch between "[[brain]]" and "body" in people with psychological trauma?
	1. their bodies register the threat, but their conscious minds go on as if nothing has happened^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 61]
		1. e.g. drugs and alcohol can also cause this mismatch
2. how can "psychosomatism" be used to treat "psychological trauma"?
	1. bottom up ([[afferent pathway|afferent]]): by allowing the body to have experiences that deeply and viscerally contradict the helplessness, rage, or collapse that result from trauma^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 14]

	2. **related**
		1. [[familiarity heuristic]]
2. what could cause people to return to situations causing negative feelings?
	1. At this point, just as with [[drug]] addiction, we start to crave the activity and experience withdrawal when it’s not available. **In the long run people become more preoccupied with the pain of withdrawal than the activity itself**.^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 46]
		1. **related**: adaptation ([[happiness]])

## [[psychological stress]]
1. why do some people with psychological trauma seek [[psychological stress]]?
	1. We concluded that Beecher’s speculation that “strong emotions can block pain” was the result of the release of morphinelike substances manufactured in the [[brain]]. This suggested that for many traumatized people, reexposure to [[stress]] might provide a similar relief from anxiety.^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 46]

## intrapersonal
1. being traumatized means continuing to organize your life as if the trauma were still going on^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 66]
2. does the book "The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 91" think desensitization via reexposure to past traumas is effective? + why?
	1. no, because that usually still leads to people not being "fully alive" in the present
3. psychological trauma → [[behavioral plasticity]]
	1. the former probably decreases the latter
	2. **see also**: The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 119–120

### [[emotion]]
1. why are psychologically traumatized people afraid to experience their emotions?^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 391]

## [[interpersonal relationship|interpersonal]]
1. any sort of deep intimacy—a close embrace, sleeping with a mate, and [[sexual intercourse]]—requires allowing oneself to experience immobilization without fear^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma]

### treatment
1. complexity · [[human]]-dog relationship → psychological trauma (treatment)^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 99]

#### [[human memory]]
1. (familiar ↮ stranger) · abuse → [[memory]]^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 227]
	1. [[women]] who were younger at the [[time]] of the incident and those who were molested by someone they knew were more likely to have forgotten their abuse
		1. why? e.g. not seeing it as abuse?
		2. why "women"? due to study set-up?

### [[culture]]
1. [[culture]] → psychological trauma^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 222–223]
	1. [[culture]] shapes the expression of traumatic [[stress]] e.g. while the World War I soldiers flail, have facial tics, and collapse with paralyzed bodies, the following generation talks and cringe

## [[trauma trigger]]
1. how could "[[thematic apperception test]]" indicate that people with psychological trauma see triggers everywhere?^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 133]
	1. due to the images being ordinary
		1. We had not selected these photos because they had some hidden meaning that sensitive people could uncover; they were ordinary images of everyday life. We could only conclude that for abused children, the whole world is filled with triggers. As long as they can imagine only disastrous outcomes to relatively benign situations, anybody walking into a room, any stranger, any image, on a screen or on a billboard might be perceived as a harbinger of catastrophe.

## [[learned helplessness]]
1. ...he and Seligman had found that the only way to teach the traumatized dogs to get off the electric grids when the doors were open was to repeatedly drag them out of their cages so they could physically experience how they could get away^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 44]
	1. **related**: [[amygdala-based anxiety]]
	2. did my patients also need to have physical experiences to restore a visceral sense of control?^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 44]

3. overprotection → [[learned helplessness]] (parenting)
	1. ◇overprotection usually leads to many learned helplessnesses
4. what could be a heavy weighing factor why you easily give up when someone misunderstands you?
	1. 'learned' helplessness via overprotective caregivers
		1. In contrast, children with histories of abuse and neglect learn that their terror, pleading, and crying do not register with their caregiver. Nothing they can do or say stops the beating or brings attention and help. **In effect they’re being conditioned to give up when they face challenges later in life**.^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 138]
	2. you tend to 'choose' freeze/flight (instead of fight), usually

## [[looking-glass self]]
1. lack of attunement → [[looking-glass self]] ([[developmental psychology]])
	1. a lack of attunement can lead to the one experiencing it to try to compensate harder and feel, therefore, 'not good enough' (until attunement reinitiates)
	2. can lead to the one experiencing it to shutdown their psychological/physical needs (and therefore experience the lack of attunement less)^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 138]
		1. If a mother cannot meet her baby’s impulses and needs, “the baby learns to become the mother’s idea of what the baby is.” Having to discount its inner sensations, and trying to adjust to its caregiver’s needs, means the child perceives that “something is wrong” with the way it.^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 138]
		2. **see also**: [[acute stress response]] (1: fight + 2: freeze/flight)

## [[hope]]

## [[depersonalization]]
1. blanking out in response to being reminded of past trauma is an example of "[[depersonalization]]"^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 89]
2. how could "[[depersonalization]]" be more damaging long-term for kids/people than those who act out?
	1. the acting-out kids tend to get attention; the blanked-out ones don’t bother anybody and are left to lose their future bit by bit^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 90–91]

### treatment
1. conventional talk therapy → psychological trauma · [[depersonalization]]^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 90]
	1. former is not as effective in treating psychological trauma
		1. severely traumatized people may get more out of simply helping to arrange chairs before a meeting than they would from sitting in those same chairs and discussing the failures in their life^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 106]

		1. other: fibromyalgia, back and neck pain, migraines, digestive problems, irritable bowel [[syndrome]], chronic fatigue
3. psychological trauma → [[subjective vitality]]
	1. traumatized people keep secreting large amounts of [[stress]] hormones long after the actual danger has passed^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma], which can reduce [[subjective vitality]]
4. psychological trauma → proprioception
	1. the former usually decreases the latter^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 111]

## [[amygdala]]
1. [[serotonin]] → [[amygdala]]
	1. animals with low [[serotonin]] levels were hyperreactive to stressful stimuli (like loud sounds), while higher levels of [[serotonin]] dampened their fear [[system]], making them less likely to become aggressive or frozen in response to potential threats^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 47]

## (sub)[[consciousness]]
1. what could cause the following? ([[neurophysiology]])^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 276]
	1. *The soldiers told horrible tales of death and destruction, but I noticed that their bodies often simultaneously radiated a sense of pride and belonging. Similarly, many patients tell me about the happy families they grew up in while their bodies are slumped over and their voices sound anxious and uptight.*

		>One system creates a story for public consumption, and if we tell that story often enough, we are likely to start believing that it contains the whole truth. But the other system registers a different truth: how we experience the situation deep inside.
		
		It is this second system that needs to be accessed, befriended, and reconciled.
		
		the first is more conscious and the second more subconscious

### [[thalamus]]
1. why is a traumatic [[memory]] "fragmented" at its creation ([[neurophysiology]])?
	1. the right and left areas of the [[thalamus]] are inactive
		1. breakdown of the [[thalamus]] explains why trauma is primarily remembered not as a story, a narrative with a beginning middle and end, but as isolated sensory imprints^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 87]

## [[thalamus]]
1. psychological trauma → [[thalamus]] ([[neuropsychology]])^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 87]
	1. the [[thalamus]] is less able to effectively filter external [[information]] in people with psychological trauma
		1. In order to cope, they try to shut themselves down and develop tunnel vision and hyperfocus. If they can’t shut down naturally, they may enlist drugs or alcohol to block out the world. The tragedy is that the price of closing down includes filtering out sources of [[pleasure]] and joy, as well.
