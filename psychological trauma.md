# [[psychology]]
1. psychological trauma (chameleon analogy)^[Alok Kanojia, Wednesday 23/06/2021]
	1. trauma tends to "disguise" itself as other mental illnesses (e.g. [[depression]], anxiety) fixing e.g. [[depression]] brings [[anxiety disorder]], which brings something else once 'cured'
	2. *I didnt even know about cptsd and, for such a long [[time]], tried to tackle my anxiety and [[depression]] instead. I really thought I was creating my own problems subconsciously. While that might hold some truth, I am making leaps of progress just by understanding my cptsd and how it changed my [[brain]].*^[https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/o6kkkx/if_you_said_to_someone_my_parents_broke_my/h2tdrqb?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]



## [[developmental psychopathology]]
1. psychological trauma → puberty ([[autism]] analogy)
	1. ◇things might unfold in a lot more domains (e.g. romance, **see**: [[attachment style]]) that weren't (as) visible before during puberty?
	2. **analog**: lack of synaptic pruning ([[autism]]) · higher cognitive functions (ontogenesis) → ◇easier [[information]] overload

## [[psychosomatic]]
1. how can there be a mismatch between "[[brain]]" and "body" in people with psychological trauma?
	1. their bodies register the threat, but their conscious minds go on as if nothing has happened^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 61]
		1. e.g. drugs and alcohol can also cause this mismatch
2. how can "psychosomatism" be used to treat "psychological trauma"?
	1. bottom up ([[afferent pathway|afferent]]): by allowing the body to have experiences that deeply and viscerally contradict the helplessness, rage, or collapse that result from trauma^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 14]

## [[trust]]
1. who do people having psychological trauma tend to [[trust]]?^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 29]

		1. [[familiarity heuristic]]
2. what could cause people to return to situations causing negative feelings?
	1. At this point, just as with [[drug]] addiction, we start to crave the activity and experience withdrawal when it’s not available. **In the long run people become more preoccupied with the pain of withdrawal than the activity itself**.^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 46]
		1. **related**: adaptation ([[happiness]])

## [[psychological stress]]
1. why do some people with psychological trauma seek [[psychological stress]]?
	1. We concluded that Beecher’s speculation that “strong emotions can block pain” was the result of the release of morphinelike substances manufactured in the [[brain]]. This suggested that for many traumatized people, reexposure to stress might provide a similar relief from anxiety.^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 46]

## intrapersonal
1. being traumatized means continuing to organize your life as if the trauma were still going on^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 66]
2. does the book "The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 91" think desensitization via reexposure to past traumas is effective? + why?
	1. no, because that usually still leads to people not being "fully alive" in the present

## [[interpersonal relationship|interpersonal]]
1. any sort of deep intimacy—a close embrace, sleeping with a mate, and [[sex]]—requires allowing oneself to experience immobilization without fear^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma]

		1. when adults or children are too skittish or shut down to derive comfort from [[human]] beings, relationships with other mammals can help

## [[learned helplessness]]
1. ...he and Seligman had found that the only way to teach the traumatized dogs to get off the electric grids when the doors were open was to repeatedly drag them out of their cages so they could physically experience how they could get away^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 44]
	1. **related**: [[amygdala-based anxiety]]

	1. being able to move and do something to protect oneself is a critical factor in determining whether or not a horrible experience will leave long-lasting scars
3. overprotection → [[learned helplessness]] (parenting)
	1. ◇overprotection usually leads to many learned helplessnesses

## [[hope]]
1. psychologically traumatic experience → purpose
	1. Somehow the very event that caused them so much pain had also become their sole source of meaning. They felt fully alive only when they were revisiting their traumatic past.^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 30]

## depersonalization
1. blanking out in response to being reminded of past trauma is an example of "depersonalization"^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 89]
2. how could "depersonalization" be more damaging long-term for kids/people than those who act out?
	1. the acting-out kids tend to get attention; the blanked-out ones don’t bother anybody and are left to lose their future bit by bit^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 90–91]

### treatment
1. conventional talk therapy → psychological trauma · depersonalization^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 90]
	1. former is not as effective in treating psychological trauma
		1. severely traumatized people may get more out of simply helping to arrange chairs before a meeting than they would from sitting in those same chairs and discussing the failures in their life^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 106]
	2. a bottom-up approach is more effective e.g. acupressure, tossing a ball, Pilates, dancing

# [[physiology]]
1. another characteristic they shared was that even their most relaxed conversations seemed stilted, lacking the natural flow of gestures and facial expressions that are typical among friends^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 38]
2. psychological trauma → [[subjective vitality]]
	1. traumatized people keep secreting large amounts of stress hormones long after the actual danger has passed^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma], which can reduce [[subjective vitality]]
3. psychological trauma → proprioception
	1. the former usually decreases the latter^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 111]

# [[neuroscience]]
## [[cortex-based anxiety|cortex-]] + [[amygdala-based anxiety]]
1. psychological trauma ([[psychotherapy]]) → [[cortex]] ↮ [[amygdala]]-based anxiety

## [[cerebral hemisphere]]
1. psychological trauma (flashback) → left ↮ right hemisphere
	1. scans also revealed that during flashbacks, our subjects’ brains lit up only on the right side (and deactivate the left)^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 59]

## [[amygdala]]
1. [[serotonin]] → [[amygdala]]
	1. animals with low [[serotonin]] levels were hyperreactive to stressful stimuli (like loud sounds), while higher levels of [[serotonin]] dampened their fear [[system]], making them less likely to become aggressive or frozen in response to potential threats^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 47]

## [[frontal lobe]]
1. psychological trauma → superficial behavior ([[neurophysiology]])^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 75]

	2. including things like reduced curiosity
### [[prefrontal cortex]]
#### [[sensory gating]]
1. psychological trauma → [[sensory gating]] ([[neurophysiology]])^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 75]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_gating#Post-Traumatic_Stress_Disorder_(PTSD)]

## [[mirror neuron]]
1. psychological trauma → mirror neurons^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 74]
	1. trauma almost invariably involves not being seen, not being mirrored, and not being taken into account
	2. **treatment** needs to reactivate the capacity to safely mirror, and be mirrored, by others

## [[human memory]]
1. it is enormously difficult to organize one’s traumatic experiences into a coherent account—a narrative with a beginning, a middle, and an end^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 58]

### [[thalamus]]
1. why is a traumatic [[memory]] "fragmented" at its creation ([[neurophysiology]])?
	1. the right and left areas of the [[thalamus]] are inactive
		1. breakdown of the [[thalamus]] explains why trauma is primarily remembered not as a story, a narrative with a beginning middle and end, but as isolated sensory imprints^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 87]

## [[thalamus]]
1. psychological trauma → [[thalamus]] ([[neuropsychology]])^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 87]
	1. the [[thalamus]] is less able to effectively filter external [[information]] in people with psychological trauma
		1. In order to cope, they try to shut themselves down and develop tunnel vision and hyperfocus. If they can’t shut down naturally, they may enlist drugs or alcohol to block out the world. The tragedy is that the price of closing down includes filtering out sources of [[pleasure]] and joy, as well.
	2. **see also**
		1. [[prefrontal cortex]]
		2. [[sensory gating]]

## [[serotonin]]
1. dominant male monkeys → [[serotonin]]
