		1. e.g. drugs and alcohol can also cause this mismatch
2. how can "psychosomatism" be used to treat "psychological trauma"?

## [[trust]]

## [[psychological stress]]
1. why do some people with psychological trauma seek stress?

## [[amygdala]]
1. [[serotonin]] → [[amygdala]]
	1. animals with low [[serotonin]] levels were hyperreactive to stressful stimuli (like loud sounds), while higher levels of [[serotonin]] dampened their fear [[system]], making them less likely to become aggressive or frozen in response to potential threats^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 47]

## [[human memory]]
1. it is enormously difficult to organize one’s traumatic experiences into a coherent account—a narrative with a beginning, a middle, and an end^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 58]
