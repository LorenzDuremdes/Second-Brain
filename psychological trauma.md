# [[psychology]]
1. psychological trauma (chameleon analogy)^[Alok Kanojia, Wednesday 23/06/2021]
	1. trauma tends to "disguise" itself as other mental illnesses (e.g. [[depression]], anxiety) fixing e.g. [[depression]] brings [[anxiety disorder]], which brings something else once 'cured'
	2. *I didnt even know about cptsd and, for such a long [[time]], tried to tackle my anxiety and [[depression]] instead. I really thought I was creating my own problems subconsciously. While that might hold some truth, I am making leaps of progress just by understanding my cptsd and how it changed my [[brain]].*^[https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/o6kkkx/if_you_said_to_someone_my_parents_broke_my/h2tdrqb?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]

## [[developmental psychopathology]]
1. psychological trauma → puberty ([[autism]] analogy)
	1. ◇things might unfold in a lot more domains (e.g. romance) that weren't (as) visible before during puberty?
	2. **analog**: lack of synaptic pruning ([[autism]]) · higher cognitive functions (ontogenesis) → ◇easier [[information]] overload

## [[psychosomatic]]
1. how can there be a mismatch between "[[brain]]" and "body" in people with psychological trauma?
	1. their bodies register the threat, but their conscious minds go on as if nothing has happened^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 61]
		1. e.g. drugs and alcohol can also cause this mismatch
2. how can "psychosomatism" be used to treat "psychological trauma"?
	1. bottom up ([[afferent pathway|afferent]]): by allowing the body to have experiences that deeply and viscerally contradict the helplessness, rage, or collapse that result from trauma^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 14]

## [[trust]]
1. who do people having psychological trauma tend to [[trust]]?^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 29]

		1. [[familiarity heuristic]]
2. what could cause people to return to situations causing negative feelings?
	1. At this point, just as with [[drug]] addiction, we start to crave the activity and experience withdrawal when it’s not available. **In the long run people become more preoccupied with the pain of withdrawal than the activity itself**.^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 46]
		1. **related**: adaptation ([[happiness]])

## [[psychological stress]]
1. why do some people with psychological trauma seek [[psychological stress]]?
	1. We concluded that Beecher’s speculation that “strong emotions can block pain” was the result of the release of morphinelike substances manufactured in the [[brain]]. This suggested that for many traumatized people, reexposure to stress might provide a similar relief from anxiety.^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 46]

## intrapersonal

## [[learned helplessness]]
1. ...he and Seligman had found that the only way to teach the traumatized dogs to get off the electric grids when the doors were open was to repeatedly drag them out of their cages so they could physically experience how they could get away^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 44]
	1. **related**: [[amygdala-based anxiety]]
	2. did my patients also need to have physical experiences to restore a visceral sense of control?^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 44]
2. [[learned helplessness]] → psychological trauma^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 68–69]
	1. being able to move and do something to protect oneself is a critical factor in determining whether or not a horrible experience will leave long-lasting scars
3. overprotection → [[learned helplessness]] (parenting)
	1. ◇overprotection usually leads to many learned helplessnesses

# [[physiology]]
1. another characteristic they shared was that even their most relaxed conversations seemed stilted, lacking the natural flow of gestures and facial expressions that are typical among friends^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 38]
2. trauma → [[subjective vitality]]
	1. traumatized people keep secreting large amounts of stress hormones long after the actual danger has passed^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma], which can reduce [[subjective vitality]]

## treatment
1. **first step** to psychological trauma recovery (physiological)^[The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 84]
	1. sensing and identifying to later gain more control/redirect those bodily sensations

# [[neuroscience]]
## [[cortex-based anxiety|cortex-]] + [[amygdala-based anxiety]]
1. psychological trauma ([[psychotherapy]]) → [[cortex]] ↮ [[amygdala]]-based anxiety
	1. no matter how much insight and understanding we develop, the rational [[brain]] is basically impotent to talk the emotional [[brain]] out of its own reality^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 62]

## [[cerebral hemisphere]]
1. psychological trauma (flashback) → left ↮ right hemisphere
	1. scans also revealed that during flashbacks, our subjects’ brains lit up only on the right side (and deactivate the left)^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 59]

## [[amygdala]]
1. [[serotonin]] → [[amygdala]]
	1. animals with low [[serotonin]] levels were hyperreactive to stressful stimuli (like loud sounds), while higher levels of [[serotonin]] dampened their fear [[system]], making them less likely to become aggressive or frozen in response to potential threats^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 47]

## [[frontal lobe]]
1. psychological trauma → superficial behavior ([[neurophysiology]])^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 75]
	1. less active [[frontal lobe]]
	2. including things like reduced curiosity
### [[prefrontal cortex]]

		1. P50 (neuroscience)

## [[mirror neuron]]
1. psychological trauma → mirror neurons^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 74]
	1. trauma almost invariably involves not being seen, not being mirrored, and not being taken into account
	2. **treatment** needs to reactivate the capacity to safely mirror, and be mirrored, by others

## [[human memory]]
1. it is enormously difficult to organize one’s traumatic experiences into a coherent account—a narrative with a beginning, a middle, and an end^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 58]

## [[serotonin]]
1. dominant male monkeys → [[serotonin]]
	1. dominant male monkeys had much higher levels of [[brain]] [[serotonin]] than lower-ranking animals^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 47]

## Brodmann area 19
1. trauma → Brodmann area 19^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 58]
	1. [[brain]] activation remains for a much longer [[time]] after the original experience of the trauma. We were witnessing a [[brain]] region rekindled as if the trauma were actually occurring.

2. [[involuntary musical imagery]]
	1. melodic music has a tendency to demonstrate repeating rhythm which may lead to endless repetition, unless a climax can be achieved to break the cycle.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earworm#cite_note-31]
