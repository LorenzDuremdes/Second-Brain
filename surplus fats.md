1. surplus fats; supplying the recommended needs for carbohydrates and proteins and filling the rest with fat^[https://renaissanceperiodization.com/case-high-carb-massing/]
	1. So for example, if you’re highly active, train for 2 hours a day, and weigh 200lbs, such a diet might prescribe that you consume at least 400g of carbs that day. But if you add the calories of the proteins and only 400g of carbs, you’re not remotely in a caloric surplus. To get to that surplus, the “surplus fats” diet relies on filling the gap between “[[protein]] + carbs” calories and your hypercaloric calorie goal with exclusively fats. In the example above, this might mean eating about 175g of fats per day to get to a 4,000 calorie goal. This diet meets carb needs for performance so that you can train hard, but only adds fats once such needs are met and the calorie goal is the target.
2. The fulcrum rests on [[protein]], so the first step is determining how much [[protein]] you need. That is between 1.2-1.4 grams of [[protein]] per kilogram of body weight daily for endurance athletes. Then prioritize carbohydrates at 6-10g per kilogram of body weight because it’s the body’s preferred fuel source when performance matters. The fat content will be the calories you have leftover.^[https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/cycling-nutrition-everything-you-need-to-know/]
