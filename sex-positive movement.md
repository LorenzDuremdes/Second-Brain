1. alcohol → [[sex]]-positive people
	1. In my experience and observation, alcohol doesn’t make [[sex]]-positive people more likely to have [[sex]]. In fact, it may do the opposite. (Both I and my girlfriend Maxine have a policy: we won’t have [[sex]] with a new lover for the first time if they’ve been drinking.)^[Franklin Veaux, https://qr.ae/pvCVhT]
