1. [[perspiration|sweat rates]] exceeding 1 liter per hour are typical during moderate exercise^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 243]

# [[dehydration]]
1. hypohydration
	1. a continued state of [[dehydration]]^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 247]
## [[physiology]]
1. when does the thirst response activate?
	2. an involuntary [[dehydration]] of 2 percent or more of body weight may occur before a strong drinking response occur^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 243]
2. resting [[heart]] rate and core temperatures progressively increase with increasing levels of [[dehydration]] (Sawka et al. 1985).^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 244]
	1. why?
		1. because of the strong demand by the [[skeletal muscle|muscles]] for [[blood]] to maintain pedaling force, [[blood]] flow to other systems in the body may be reduced to maintain adequate [[blood]] pressure and [[blood]] flow back to the [[heart]]
			1. e.g. core → [[temperature]] increases
3. [[dehydration]] → skin [[blood]] flow
	1. skin [[blood]] flow diminishes
		1. propagation → apart from sweating, skin [[blood]] flow is another important pathway for the body to get rid of extra heat^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 244]
		2. reduced skin [[blood]] flow causes e.g. higher core temperatures
4. shunting → [[dehydration]]
	1. [[blood]] flow to the digestive system, including the stomach, intestines, and kidneys, diminishes, impairing the ability of the body to take in additional [[food]] and [[fluid]] during exercise^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 244]
5. [[dehydration]] → [[lipopolysaccharide]]
	1. [[dehydration]] (and redistribution of [[blood]] e.g. shunting) can cause [[endotoxemia]]
		1. has been associated with impaired muscle function (Supinski et al. 2000) and may produce an inflammatory response in the body that contributes to exercise fatigue, especially in the heat (Lambert 2004).^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, 245]
6. heat stress → [[blood]]-[[brain]] barrier^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 245]
	1. the [[blood]]–[[brain]] barrier, which protects the [[brain]] from being exposed to damaging substances in the [[blood]], may become leakier (Watson et al. 2005)
		1. in combination with [[physical exercise]]
		2. Also, reduced [[blood]] flow and heat stress may alter [[brain]] metabolism and neurochemistry, which may contribute to changes in mental arousal and fatigue (Meeusen et al. 2006).
7. low levels of [[blood]] [[sodium]] concentration and [[blood]] dilution may cause symptoms such as “confusion, disorientation, progressively worsening headache, nausea, vomiting, aphasia, impaired coordination, muscle cramps, and muscle weakness. Complications of severe [[hyponatremia]] include cerebral and pulmonary edema that can result in seizure, coma, and cardiorespiratory arrest” (Casa et al. 2005).^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 251]
	1. how?
		1. this degree of dilution of the [[blood]] may produce dangerous swelling of the [[central nervous system]]

### [[VO2 max]]
1. how can [[dehydration]] lower VO<sub>2</sub>max?
	1. stroke volume decreases due to less [[plasma]] volume (being used as sweat), which reduces VO<sub>2</sub>max^[The Time-Crunched Cyclist: Race-Winning Fitness in 6 Hours a Week, 3rd Edition, p. 45]
2. how can [[dehydration]] increase RPE at same intensity when hydrated?
	1. lower [[VO2 max]] makes any given intensity a higher percentage of your [[VO2 max]] and [[lactate threshold]]^[The Time-Crunched Cyclist: Race-Winning Fitness in 6 Hours a Week, 3rd Edition, p. 45]

## performance
1. hydration during exercise → recovery
	1. riders can tolerate mild [[dehydration]] during exercise to a certain extent, but too much of a deficit during exercise eventually impairs performance and makes it harder to recover adequately for subsequent training^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 244]
2. 
3. Eight well-trained male cyclists consumed either 2.4 liters of a 7 percent [[carbohydrate]] drink or .4 liter of [[water]] with sufficient gels to provide equal [[carbohydrate]] consumption during a 2-hour endurance ride in a 30 °C lab [[temperature]]. The subjects then rode to exhaustion at 88 percent of maximal aerobic power. As expected, body weight was lower with the gel condition. **These subjects were 1.9 kilograms lighter** because of their low [[fluid]] intake, and a lower power output was sufficient for them to maintain a constant speed.^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 249]
4. can [[dehydration]] improve the power-to-weight ratio? + why
	1. overall, any power-to-weight advantage from voluntary [[dehydration]] was offset by the physiological and performance impairment^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 249]
	2. **see also:** nidd1611256812790
5. when do [[dehydration]] effects impair **aerobic** capacity?^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 250]
	1. >2% body weight [[dehydration]]
		1. especially with exercise in heat
6. when do [[dehydration]] effects impair **anaerobic** performance?
	1. 3–5% of body weight [[dehydration]]^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 250]

### strength vs. endurance
1. a sustained state of lower [[fluid balance]] can impair **strength, power, and high-intensity [[muscular endurance]]** by 2, 3, and 10 percent, respectively^[Judelson et al. (2007)]^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 247]
	1. why "strength" less than "power" (or any combination)?
		1. lower [[fluid balance]] → more important in (high-intensity) [[muscular endurance]]?
		2. intramuscular hydration ↔ plasma osmolality
			1. research has indicated a correlation between reduction in intramuscular hydration (water in muscle cells) and reduced plasma osmolality^[The Time-Crunched Cyclist: Race-Winning Fitness in 6 Hours a Week, 3rd Edition, p. 45]
	2. [[dehydration]] affects endurance athletes more^[The Time-Crunched Cyclist: Race-Winning Fitness in 6 Hours a Week, 3rd Edition, p. 45]
		1. **why**? muscles cells retain a large portion of their water content even with large increases in plasma osmolality^[Pitcavage et al. 1962]^[The Time-Crunched Cyclist: Race-Winning Fitness in 6 Hours a Week, 3rd Edition, p. 45]
2. why are strength athletes more easily able to cut water weight as opposed to endurance athletes?
	1. The other reason is that wrestlers, boxers, and mixed martial arts fighters have time to partially **rehydrate between weigh-ins and competition**. So, while athletes may “make weight” on the scale, in the time between weigh-ins and competition they can ingest fluids to at least partially rehydrate themselves. This will increase their actual weight, but weight gain in this manner is allowed within the rules.^[The Time-Crunched Cyclist: Race-Winning Fitness in 6 Hours a Week, 3rd Edition]

# rehydration
1. when did rehydration became a more common/acceptable/science-based practice during [[aerobic exercise]]?^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 251]
	1. people usually overhydrated (e.g. causing [[hyponatremia]])
2. how to reduce risk of [[hyponatremia]] during [[aerobic exercise]]?^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 250]
	1. by (adding) .3 to .7 gram per liter of [[sodium]] to your drink/[[water]]
	2. [[fluid]] intake below sweating rates (why?)
		1. e.g. to avoid the body from extricating fluids (pee), which brings along [[sodium]]?
		2. due to dilution of the [[blood]]?^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 251]
3. average hydration per hour^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 253]
	1. .4 to .8 liter per hour
		1. large individuals who are heavy sweaters and are exercising in the heat may lean toward the higher end of this range, and small individuals who are exercising at low intensities in a cool environment may aim toward the lower rate
		2. should be below sweating rates to e.g. prevent [[hyponatremia]] while avoiding ≥2% bodyweight [[dehydration]]
## content
1. in one of the few studies that looked at voluntary drinking behavior in humans, a [[water]] [[temperature]] of 15 °C had the highest consumption rate in subjects who were allowed to choose the [[water]] [[temperature]] (Boulze et al. 1983)^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 253]
2. cooling and flavoring drinks increased the consumption rate; consumption of flavored [[water]] at 15 °C was 120 percent greater than consumption of unflavored [[water]] at 40 °C (Hubbard et al. 1984)^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 253]
3. [[carbohydrate]] vs. [[carbohydrate]]-[[protein]] [[sport]] drink
	1. the latter is more effective^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 259]
	2. how much performance advantage does a [[carbohydrate]]-[[protein]] give as opposed to [[carbohydrate]] only?^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 259]
		1. +~10%
		2. With 75 percent and 85 percent O2max rides to exhaustion, in which subjects were asked to ride at a set workload for as long as possible, exercise tolerance time increased dramatically to 29 percent and 45 percent longer at 75 and 85 percent of O2max respectively.
	3. the scientific consensus is that the ceiling for [[carbohydrate]] absorption is already reached at 6 to 8 percent concentration and that simply adding more [[carbohydrate]] does not get more into your system and may even slow things down in the digestive tract. Therefore, adding [[protein]] seemed to serve as a back-door way to cram more calories into your system.
4. [[protein]] addition → suboptimal [[carbohydrate]] replacement (<60 grams per hour) during a cycling [[time trial]]
	1. The rate of [[fluid]] ingestion may be one of the major reasons for the difference between the two studies. Saunders et al. (2004) had a relatively low (500 milliliters per hour) drinking rate, resulting in about 37 grams per hour of [[carbohydrate]] replacement. This quantity is much lower than the 60 grams per hour recommended to maximize [[carbohydrate]] replacement in the body. Therefore, the extra [[protein]] may play an important role only when [[carbohydrate]] replacement is less than optimal. Regardless, the jury is still out on how important [[protein]] is during cycling.^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 260]
## performance
1. [[carbohydrate]] consumption before event → can act as an ergogenic^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 255]
	1. e.g. sports/[[energy]] drinks
2. possible reason for improved performance from the [[carbohydrate]] mouth rinse
	1. one possibility is that, because the [[brain]] generally runs only on [[carbohydrate]], some direct stimulation of [[carbohydrate]] receptors in the mouth may have altered [[brain]] activity, arousal, or the subconscious perception of effort and available [[energy]]

		Namely, self-paced effort may be selected by a “smart sensor” somewhere in the [[brain]] that integrates input from throughout the body. The presence of [[carbohydrate]] may trigger sensors in the mouth to relay positive information to the [[brain]] and allow it to select a higher pace.
		
		Given such findings, even in cool temperatures in which [[dehydration]] or heat stress is not a major concern, it maybe worthwhile to try a small bottle of [[sports drink]] or a gel immediately before or during short and high-intensity events of 60 to 90 minutes, including time trials, cyclocross, and many mountain biking events.^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 256]
		1. **related**: [[central governor]]
## [[physiology]]
1. how long till [[fluid]] enters the bloodstream (when not physically exercising)?^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 257]
	1. 15 to 30 minutes
	2. A direct relationship is observed between the amount of [[fluid]] ingested and the rate of [[gastric emptying]].
		1. probably higher [[fluid]] intake increases rate of [[gastric emptying]]
2. why does the book "Cutting-Edge Cycling (p. 257)" suggest to drink early on?
	1. As previously noted, however, high volumes of unabsorbed [[fluid]] in the stomach may also lead to gastric discomfort. You may need to begin drinking early in a long ride because the reduced [[blood]] flow to the digestive system can inhibit the rate of [[gastric emptying]] (Rowell 1974).
# overhydration
1. symptoms of overhydration (especially combined with [[physical exercise]] and heat) are similar to symptoms of [[dehydration]]^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 251]
2. hyperhydration → dilute [[plasma]] [[sodium]] → enhance the risk of dilutional [[hyponatremia]]^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 260]
3. how does [[glycerol]] solution increase the risk of hyperhydration?
	1. [[glycerol]] solution aids in the retention of [[fluid]]^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 260]
4. total amount of hyperhydration possible + why
	1. ~1–2% above normal body weight. This state is inherently unstable, because the body will rapidly strive to increase [[fluid]] excretion to return to baseline hydration levels, such that proper timing would be essential if this practice is employed.^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 260]
		1. what is meant with "proper timing would be essential if this practice is employed?" → (dis)advantages? + how
5. overhydration → [[thermoregulation]]
	1. furthermore, no scientific study has been able to demonstrate a clear thermoregulatory or performance advantage from this practice (Latzka et al. 1997, 1998). Therefore, the best suggestion remains to focus on ensuring that you are normally hydrated before exercise in the heat.^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 260]
# measuring
1. assessing hydration status via "body weight_morning" or "following exercising" has high practicality but low reliability^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 258]
2. assessing hydration status via "urine color" has a high practicality^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 258]
	1. the closer to "very pale yellow" the more well hydrated
	2. brownish green indicates [[dehydration]]
3. assessing hydration status via "urine specific gravity" has high practicality^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 258]
	1. main use for chronic rather than acute hydration assessment
	2. normal hydration threshold = <1020 grams per milliliter
