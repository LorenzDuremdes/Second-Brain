1. [[food|foods]] containing both [[sugar]] and [[fat]] rarely occur in nature^[The Hungry Brain (Stephan J. Guyenet, Ph.D.), p. 88]
2. why have humans evolved a very sophisticated detection system in our mouths for glutamate, guanylate, and inosinate?
	1. because they signify easily digestible [[protein]] not the protein of raw [[meat]], but the protein of perfectly aged, cooked meat. They’re the signature of fermented [[fish]] and [[plant|plants]], rich meaty [[bouillon|broths]], vintage cheese. That’s why foods with these molecules in them taste great.^[Ultra-Processed People The Science Behind the Food That Isnt Food (Chris van Tulleken), p. 172]
	2. they are all usually added (in conjunction) in UPF

# [[food]]
1. we may be eating more food to compensate for becoming increasingly [[micronutrient deficient|deficient in micronutrients]]. Ultra-processing reduces [[micronutrient|micronutrients]] to the point that modern diets lead to [[malnutrition]] even as they cause obesity^[Ultra-Processed People The Science Behind the Food That Isnt Food (Chris van Tulleken), p. 168]

## [[sweetener]]
1. how can sweeteners cause hunger (physiology)?
	1. When sweeteners are consumed with even a small amount of sugar, insulin levels seem to rise significantly. This will cause a drop in blood sugar and may then cause hunger, driving increased intake of food^[Ultra-Processed People The Science Behind the Food That Isnt Food (Chris van Tulleken), p. 180]

# [[obesity]]
1. is obesity simply a matter of 'being surrounded by too delicious food e.g. UPF' + why
	1. Hall’s theory is not simply that UPF food is delicious and so creates ‘hedonic overdrive’, where we enjoy eating more than we hate being full. Instead, it’s that the new UPF food environment is affecting our ability to self-regulate.
	   
	   And indeed, while exactly how our current food system breaks or bypasses our evolved method of regulating weight is unknown, an increasing number of studies are showing that every aspect of UPF disrupts our multi-million-year-old network of regulatory neurons and [[hormone|hormones]].^[Ultra-Processed People The Science Behind the Food That Isnt Food (Chris van Tulleken), p. 96]
2. in Hall’s experiment, the softness plus the calorie density meant that participants consumed an average of seventeen calories per minute more when eating UPF compared to the unprocessed diet.^[Ultra-Processed People The Science Behind the Food That Isnt Food (Chris van Tulleken), p. 157]

# [[economics]]
1. the poorest 50 per cent of households would need to spend almost 30 per cent of their disposable income on [[food]] if they wanted to eat a diet that adheres to our national healthy-eating guidelines. The poorest 10 per cent of households by income would need to spend almost 75 per cent. UPF is almost universally cheaper, quicker and supposedly just as nutritious – if not more so – than foods and meals that need home preparation. Perhaps it’s no surprise that UPF is eaten in greater quantities in countries like the UK and USA that are more economically unequal than similar high-income countries^[Ultra-Processed People The Science Behind the Food That Isnt Food (Chris van Tulleken), p. 20–21]

# [[history]]
1. when did ultra-processed food emerge?
	1. These substances entered the diet gradually at first, beginning in the last part of the nineteenth century, but the incursion gained pace from the 1950s onwards, to the point that they now constitute the majority of what people eat in the UK and the USA, and form a significant part of the diet of nearly every [[society]] on earth.^[Ultra-Processed People The Science Behind the Food That Isnt Food (Chris van Tulleken), p. 10]
