1. whenever you record a zero in your training diary, you have lost fitness

	You may not agree with me on this. Many athletes think they gain fitness by taking a day off because they may train or race really well the next day. What they are actually experiencing, however, is something called “form,” which we’ll return to soon in this chapter. Fact is, you can’t gain fitness by resting. Only by working out do you become more fit. A day off means a loss of fitness. To be sure, it’s a very small loss—so small, in fact, that it couldn’t be measured in an exercise [[physiology]] lab. After several such days off from training, however, the loss would become great enough that it could be measured. That’s reversibility. Use it or lose it.^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 15]
