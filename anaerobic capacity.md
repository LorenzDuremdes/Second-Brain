1. anaerobic threshold; the percentage of your aerobic capacity that you are capable of sustaining for a long time, such as 40 to 70 minutes. The higher the percentage, the greater your anaerobic threshold fitness^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 13]
2. in what units do we measure the size of our anaerobic capacity?^[https://youtu.be/RYJS8CqSi84?t=4020]
	1. joules
		1. expenditure follows a linear trend e.g. Z7 doesn't necessarily consume more joules (external forces adjusted) than Z6
3. anaerobic threshold has a higher RPE than [[aerobic threshold]]^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 16]

1. how to improve anaerobic endurance?
	1. zone 6 (mostly HIIT)^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 19]
2. rest intervals shorter than 3 min may not represent the optimal protocol for an athlete training for anaerobic work capacity improvements since ATP recovery requires approximately 3-5 min, and PCr fully recovers at approximately 8 min (5, 43, 49) (**HVRT**)^[[High Volume Resistance Training and its Effects on Anaerobic Work Capacities Over Time: A Review – The Sport Journal](https://thesportjournal.org/article/high-volume-resistance-training-and-its-effects-on-anaerobic-work-capacities-over-time-a-review/)]
	1. findings from this review indicate that a moderately high VL consisting of approximately **4 ± 1 sets of 12 ± 3 repetitions** can improve AWC more efficiently than higher VL training while mitigating strength losses
	2. calculations of ES indicate that training 3×10-15 repetitions may be the most advantageous method to improve AWC and strength.
		1. the studies all did this twice per week (there's not explicitly being mentioned this might be most optimal)
