1. anaerobic threshold; the percentage of your aerobic capacity that you are capable of sustaining for a long time, such as 40 to 70 minutes. The higher the percentage, the greater your anaerobic threshold fitness^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 13]
2. in what units do we measure the size of our anaerobic capacity?^[https://youtu.be/RYJS8CqSi84?t=4020]
	1. joules
		1. expenditure follows a linear trend e.g. Z7 doesn't necessarily consume more joules (external forces adjusted) than Z6
3. anaerobic threshold has a higher RPE than [[aerobic threshold]]^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 16]
4. how to improve anaerobic endurance?
	1. zone 6 (mostly HIIT)^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 19]
