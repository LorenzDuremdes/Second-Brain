		1. Hifiman Arya. I feel like I'm in a movie theater

1. I can say that compared to the Sundara, these have a couple great advantages. They have excellent well extended bass - that has great slam/impact (especially with EQ). The layering and separation is fantastic, it brings out a lot of details I didn't notice before in music/movies/games. The soundstage and imaging really makes things feel much more spacious and immersive.^[[Hifiman Edition XS Launched | Page 57 | Headphone Reviews and Discussion - Head-Fi.org](https://www.head-fi.org/threads/hifiman-edition-xs-launched.960155/page-57)]
	1. SOUND: Now, here's the deal. I can't hear much if any difference between these two headphones. Or, if I think I do, it isn't as obvious when I do another pass. I spent hours going back and forth. These are definitely the most similar sounding headphones I've ever compared, and I think I've been dreading this moment for my entire time in this hobby. Perhaps this is the limit of my ability to analyze audio?
2. I don't find the Arya has larger soundstage, if anything the Edition XS has very slightly larger. They are close enough it's a toss-up.^[[Anyone else prefer the Edition XS over the Arya? : r/headphones (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/y6y1wt/anyone_else_prefer_the_edition_xs_over_the_arya/)]
3. Gamers and people listening to binaural audio will likely notice the biggest improvement, and this is the true dealmaker for the XS. The perceived larger space on your head allows for more precise imaging as well and locating sound should be no trouble on the XS.^[[HIFIMAN Edition XS Planar Magnetic Stealth Magnet Hi-Fi Headphones with Travel Case for Headphones - Black : Amazon.nl: Electronics & Photo](https://www.amazon.nl/-/en/XS-Magnetic-Headphones-Travel-Case/dp/B0BTYSTNBF)]
4. I would define Sundara's sound stage as a medium sized concert stage with a platform in the middle of the pit for singers and guitars. EDXS is like a large and even concert stage, where everything is distributed equally.^[[The Hifiman shopping spree (my take on Sundara vs Edition XS) : r/headphones (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/u3lmvb/the_hifiman_shopping_spree_my_take_on_sundara_vs/)]
