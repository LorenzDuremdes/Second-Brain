2. Massive Soundstage​
   
   Planars have a flat diaphragm and Hifiman Planars especially have extra thin diagphram’s providing much more sound from a larger surface in each ear. Further the earpads on the Hifiman XS are angled which enhances that sense of listening to music presented in front of you. This together with the open back mean they sound much more like I can in a room than with other headphones (including the AKG K702) with different instruments / vocals in clearly separately distinct places in 3D space.

3. I don't find the Arya has larger soundstage, if anything the Edition XS has very slightly larger. They are close enough it's a toss-up.^[[Anyone else prefer the Edition XS over the Arya? : r/headphones (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/y6y1wt/anyone_else_prefer_the_edition_xs_over_the_arya/)]
4. Gamers and people listening to binaural audio will likely notice the biggest improvement, and this is the true dealmaker for the XS. The perceived larger space on your head allows for more precise imaging as well and locating sound should be no trouble on the XS.^[[HIFIMAN Edition XS Planar Magnetic Stealth Magnet Hi-Fi Headphones with Travel Case for Headphones - Black : Amazon.nl: Electronics & Photo](https://www.amazon.nl/-/en/XS-Magnetic-Headphones-Travel-Case/dp/B0BTYSTNBF)]
