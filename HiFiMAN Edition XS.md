		1. [[Hifiman Arya]]. I feel like I'm in a movie theater
		2. IT will literally be night and day. I like Focal [[headphones]] but they have a really intimate soundstage, not much separation but a still very 3d like imaging. The Arya SE have a very wide and more importantly very tall soundstage. It is much more concert hall like. The separation is much better and while the Focals imaging is probably slightly more accurate the added space and separation make the whole experience much better for me. Don't have that same slam though the Focals are known for but it is very well extended and takes to EQ very well if you want to add a nice shelf.

1. I can say that compared to the Sundara, these have a couple great advantages. They have excellent well extended bass - that has great slam/impact (especially with EQ). The layering and separation is fantastic, it brings out a lot of details I didn't notice before in [[music]]/movies/games. The soundstage and imaging really makes things feel much more spacious and immersive.^[[Hifiman Edition XS Launched | Page 57 | Headphone Reviews and Discussion - Head-Fi.org](https://www.head-fi.org/threads/hifiman-edition-xs-launched.960155/page-57)]
	1. SOUND: Now, here's the deal. I can't hear much if any difference between these two [[headphones]]. Or, if I think I do, it isn't as obvious when I do another pass. I spent hours going back and forth. These are definitely the most similar sounding [[headphones]] I've ever compared, and I think I've been dreading this moment for my entire time in this [[hobby]]. Perhaps this is the limit of my ability to analyze [[audio]]?
2. I don't find the Arya has larger soundstage, if anything the Edition XS has very slightly larger. They are close enough it's a toss-up.^[[Anyone else prefer the Edition XS over the Arya? : r/headphones (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/y6y1wt/anyone_else_prefer_the_edition_xs_over_the_arya/)]
3. Gamers and people listening to binaural [[audio]] will likely notice the biggest improvement, and this is the true dealmaker for the XS. The perceived larger space on your head allows for more precise imaging as well and locating sound should be no trouble on the XS.^[[HIFIMAN Edition XS Planar Magnetic Stealth Magnet Hi-Fi Headphones with Travel Case for Headphones - Black : Amazon.nl: Electronics & Photo](https://www.amazon.nl/-/en/XS-Magnetic-Headphones-Travel-Case/dp/B0BTYSTNBF)]
4. I would define Sundara's sound stage as a medium sized concert stage with a platform in the middle of the pit for singers and guitars. EDXS is like a large and even concert stage, where everything is distributed equally.^[[The Hifiman shopping spree (my take on Sundara vs Edition XS) : r/headphones (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/u3lmvb/the_hifiman_shopping_spree_my_take_on_sundara_vs/)]
5. When driven properly, the HIFIMAN Edition XS sounds exactly as a pair of ultra high end speakers with warm tuning, in a well treated room. The reason I’m using this description is that the soundstage and naturalness of Edition XS is unique, they are incredibly open and transparent, and when they are driven well, the impact and dynamics are better than most headphones can offer, regardless of the price range.^[[HIFIMAN Edition XS - King Of Stealth & Neo Supernano — Audiophile Heaven (audiophile-heaven.com)](https://www.audiophile-heaven.com/2022/04/hifiman-edition-xs-king-of-stealth-neo-supernano.html)]
6. the Soundstage of the Edition XS seems wider than both the Ananda and SUNDARA which makes it sound more grandiose and bigger than the other two. The scale of orchestra pieces is insane on these [[headphones]].^[[HIFIMAN Edition XS Review: Now This Changes Things! (Incl.

7. Lcd X does sound great but the soundstage of edition XS just really sealed the deal for me... Auditioned both of these [[headphones]] yesterday and bought the XS.^[[Does a $500 Hifiman Beat a $1200 Audeze? The Audeze LCD-X Review (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGfJJr8Z1oM)]
