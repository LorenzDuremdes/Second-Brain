1. isotope; two or more types of atoms that have the same atomic number (number of protons in their nuclei) and position in the periodic table (and hence belong to the same chemical element), and that differ in nucleon numbers (mass numbers) due to different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope]
	1. for example, [[carbon-12]], carbon-13, and carbon-14 are three isotopes of the element carbon with mass numbers 12, 13, and 14, respectively. The atomic number of carbon is 6, which means that every carbon [[atom]] has 6 protons so that the neutron numbers of these isotopes are 6, 7, and 8 respectively.
