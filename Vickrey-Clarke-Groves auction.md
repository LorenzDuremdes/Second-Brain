1. Bidder A wants one apple and is willing to pay $5 for that apple.
2. Bidder B wants one apple and is willing to pay $2 for it.
3. Bidder C wants two apples and is willing to pay $6 to have both of them but is uninterested in buying only one without the other.
	1. **A pays**
	   5(A) + 2(B) = 7
	   7(A+B) - 5(A) = 2
	   6(C) - 22 = 4
	2. **B pays**
	   5(A) + 2(B) = 7
	   7(A+B) - 2(B) = 5
	   6(C) - 52 = 1
		1. after the auction, A is $1 better off than before (paying $4 to gain $5 of utility), B is $1 better off than before (paying $1 to gain $2 of utility), and C is neutral (having not won anything)
