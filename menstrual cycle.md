# biopsychology
1. menstrual cycle → **sexual desire** (female)
	1. many females experience heightened sexual desire in the several days immediately before ovulation.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulation#cite_note-pmid15216427-24]
		1. due to e.g. high levels of estrogen and androgens^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstruation#cite_note-49]
		2. one study concluded that females subtly improve their **facial attractiveness** during ovulation.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulation#cite_note-25]
	2. menstrual cycle → **reduced** sexual desire^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstruation#cite_note-49]
		1. relatively lower interest directly prior to and during menstruation

# [[physiology]]
1. menstrual cycle → basal **body temperature**
	1. "basal body temperature" is lower during "follicular phase" and higher during "luteal phase"
		
		Ovulation occurs about midway through the menstrual cycle, after the follicular phase, and is followed by the luteal phase. Note that ovulation is characterized by a sharp spike in levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), resulting from the peak of estrogen levels during the follicular phase.^[By Isometrik - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=8703107]

2. when does **ovulation** occur in humans?
	1. ~midway through the menstrual cycle (day 14)^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovulation]
3. when does "**menstruation**" occur?
	1. the beginning of a menstrual cycle (menses)
	2. The ovarian cycle consists of alternating follicular and luteal phases, and the uterine cycle consists of menstruation, the proliferative phase, and the secretory phase.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle#cite_note-FOOTNOTETortora2017944-2]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle#Cycles_and_phases]
4. menstrual cycle (**young** [[women]])
	1. 21–45 days^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstruation#cite_note-Women2014Men-2]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstruation#cite_note-Diaz2006-3]
5. menstrual cycle (**adult** [[women]])
	1. 21–31 days with the average being 28 days^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstruation#cite_note-Women2014Men-2]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstruation#cite_note-Diaz2006-3]

## things influencing menstrual cycle
1. intensity (**physical exercise**) → menstrual cycle^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle#cite_note-Liu-62]
	1. Anovulatory cycles or short luteal phases are normal when [[women]] are under [[stress]] or athletes increasing the intensity of training. These changes are reversible as the stressors decrease or, in the case of the athlete, as she adapts to the training.

# [[neuroscience]]
1. menstrual cycle → spatial reasoning ability^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle#cite_note-FOOTNOTEElse-QuestHyde2021258–61-75]
	1. improvements in spatial reasoning ability during the menstruation phase of the cycle
		1. probably caused by decreases in levels of estrogen and progesterone.
