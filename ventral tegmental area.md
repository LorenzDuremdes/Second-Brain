1. ventral tegmental area ([[neurophysiology]]); the origin of the dopaminergic cell bodies of the [[mesocorticolimbic system|mesocorticolimbic dopamine system]] and other [[dopamine pathways]]; it is widely implicated in the [[drug]] and natural reward circuitry of the [[brain]]
   
   the VTA plays an important role in a number of processes, including reward [[cognition]] ([[motivational salience]], [[associative learning]], and positively-valenced emotions) and orgasm, among others, as well as several psychiatric disorders
   
   as stated above, the VTA, in particular the VTA [[dopamine]] neurons, serve several functions in the [[reward system]], [[motivation]], [[cognition]], and [[substance dependence|drug addiction]], and may be the focus of several psychiatric disorders.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventral_tegmental_area]
2. ventral tegmental area [[dopaminergic neuron|dopamine neurons]] â†’ [[sleep]]
	1. Recently, research on sleep preparatory behaviours, for example, nest building in the case of mice, suggests that such behaviours require dedicated neuronal circuitry. This engages before sleep onset, requiring inhibition of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons^[[Sleep and thermoregulation - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7323637/)]
