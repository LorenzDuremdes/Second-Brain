2. the term tacit knowing is attributed to Michael Polanyi's Personal [[knowledge]] (1958).^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge#cite_note-:3-2] In his later work, The Tacit Dimension (1966), Polanyi made the assertion that "we can know more than we can tell."^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge#cite_note-3]

# example
1. one of the most convincing examples of tacit [[knowledge]] is facial recognition: one knows a person's face, and can recognize it among a thousand, indeed a million. Yet, people usually cannot tell how they recognize that face, so most of this cannot be put into words. When one sees a face, they are not conscious about their [[knowledge]] of the individual features (eye, nose, mouth), but rather see and recognize the face as a whole.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge#cite_note-17]

# synonym
1. implicit [[knowledge]]
