1. IEM vs. [[headphones]] â†’ price
	1. BC you can get really good IEMs for less than $50. Try finding a really good over-ear for less than $50.
	   
	   Much more portable and they're cheaper. Trying to find good sounding, compact, and cheap closed-back over ears is incredibly difficult.^[[IEM users - why? : r/headphones (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/174yy50/iem_users_why/)]
