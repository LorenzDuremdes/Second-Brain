# [[psychology]]
1. what could cause people with autism take things more personally?
	1. ◇less [[theory of mind]]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind#Autism]

## [[continuum|spectrum]]
1. Autism has long been thought to cover a wide spectrum, ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent, developmentally disabled, and prone to frequent repetitive behavior such as hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, pedantic [[communication]].^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#cite_note-113] Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#cite_note-Geschwind-2009-52]
## classification
1. why did "DSM-V" compress "DSM-IV autism subgroups"? (treatment)
	1. researchers found that these separate diagnoses were not **consistently** applied across different clinics and treatment centers^[https://web.archive.org/web/20131006210933/http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Autism Spectrum Disorder Fact Sheet.pdf]
		1. **related**: [[internal validity]]

### [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]
#### DSM-5 vs. DSM-4 
##### [[developmental psychology]]
1. ...it is an important change from DSM-IV criteria, which was geared toward identifying school-aged children with autism-related disorders, **but not as useful in diagnosing younger children**^[https://web.archive.org/web/20131006210933/http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Autism Spectrum Disorder Fact Sheet.pdf]
	2. The restricting of onset age has also been **loosened** from 3 years of age to "early developmental period", with a note that symptoms may manifest later when social demands exceed capabilities.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum#cite_note-IACC-28]
2. insurance
	1. state intervention may be required to ensure that these individuals who may lose or fail to receive an ASD diagnosis will have continued access to public [[health]] support services; therefore, future research is needed to determine how states respond regarding insurance coverage and services for individuals without an ASD diagnosis but who still may require assistance^[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10803-014-2065-2]

### DSM-5 vs. DSM-4 → [[psychiatric epidemiology]]
1. the DSM-5 criteria were tested in real-life clinical settings as part of DSM-5 field trials, and analysis from that testing indicated that there will be no significant changes in the prevalence of the disorder^[https://web.archive.org/web/20131006210933/http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Autism Spectrum Disorder Fact Sheet.pdf]
	1. More recently, the largest and most up-to-date study, published by Huerta, et al, in the October 2012 issue of American Journal of Psychiatry, provided the most comprehensive assessment of the DSM-5 criteria for ASD based on symptom extraction from previously collected data. The study found that DSM-5 criteria identified 91 percent of children with clinical DSM-IV PDD diagnoses, suggesting that 2 • DSM-5 Autism Spectrum Disorder Fact Sheet most children with DSM-IV PDD diagnoses will retain their diagnosis of ASD using the new criteria.
		1. Several other studies, using various methodologies, have been inconsistent in their findings.

## autism vs. [[social communication disorder]]
1. the latter contains the former _and_ a restricted pattern of behavior
	1. the diagnosis of SCD can only be given if autism has been ruled out.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_communication_disorder#cite_note-DSM5-6]
2. did the generalization of autism in DSM-V cause it to be less specific? + why
	1. no e.g. some people are now getting the diagnosis of social [[communication]] disorder (instead of e.g. PDD-NOS) → the specificity of classification increased, in this example^[https://www.autismspeaks.org/dsm-5-and-autism-frequently-asked-questions]
# [[neuroscience]]
## [[neurophysiology]]
1. autism → fusiform gyrus · difficulties
	1. may cause difficulties in face, voice, and word perception

### [[dynamic functional connectivity]]
1. [[dynamic functional connectivity]] → autism
	1. research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#cite_note-109] and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry, [[psychology]], neurology and pediatrics.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#cite_note-110]
	2. newer technologies such as fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes (observable traits) that can be viewed on brain scans, to help further neurogenetic studies of autism;^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#cite_note-111] one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain, which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#cite_note-Lev2009-20]
	3. it has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#cite_note-112] → [[biological specificity]]

## neurodiversity
1. it emerged as a challenge to prevailing views that certain neurodevelopmental disorders are inherently pathological and instead adopts the social model of disability, in which societal barriers are the main contributing factor that disables people.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiversity#cite_note-2]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiversity#cite_note-Bloomsbury-3]
	1. The subsequent neurodiversity paradigm has been controversial among disability advocates, with opponents saying that its conceptualization doesn't reflect the realities of individuals who have high support needs.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiversity#cite_note-4]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiversity#cite_note-5]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiversity#cite_note-6]

# miscellaneous
1. regressive autism; the loss of speech and social skills at approximately 15 to 30 months of age
	1. *not to be confused with: nonverbal autism*
2. autism → stochastic resonance
	1. autism is an example of too high [[stochastic resonance]] in terms of optimal functioning?
