1. regressive autism; the loss of speech and social skills at approximately 15 to 30 months of age
	1. *not to be confused with: nonverbal autism*
2. autism → stochastic resonance
	1. autism is an example of too high [[stochastic resonance]] in terms of optimal functioning?
# [[neuroscience]]
1. autism → fusiform gyrus · difficulties
	1. may cause difficulties in face, voice, and word perception

## [[dynamic functional connectivity]]
1. dynamic functional connectivity → autism
	1. research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#cite_note-109] and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry, psychology, neurology and pediatrics.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#cite_note-110]
	2. newer technologies such as fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes (observable traits) that can be viewed on brain scans, to help further neurogenetic studies of autism;^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#cite_note-111] one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain, which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#cite_note-Lev2009-20]
	3. it has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#cite_note-112] → [[biological specificity]]

### [[continuum|spectrum]]
1. Autism has long been thought to cover a wide spectrum, ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent, developmentally disabled, and prone to frequent repetitive behavior such as hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, pedantic communication.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#cite_note-113] Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism#cite_note-Geschwind-2009-52]

## neurodiversity
1. it emerged as a challenge to prevailing views that certain neurodevelopmental disorders are inherently pathological and instead adopts the social model of disability, in which societal barriers are the main contributing factor that disables people.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiversity#cite_note-2]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiversity#cite_note-Bloomsbury-3]
	1. The subsequent neurodiversity paradigm has been controversial among disability advocates, with opponents saying that its conceptualization doesn't reflect the realities of individuals who have high support needs.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiversity#cite_note-4]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiversity#cite_note-5]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiversity#cite_note-6]

# autism vs. [[social communication disorder]]
1. the latter contains the former _and_ a restricted pattern of behavior
	1. the diagnosis of SCD can only be given if autism has been ruled out.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_communication_disorder#cite_note-DSM5-6]
