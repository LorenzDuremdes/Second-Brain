   Alex Dowsett rides locally to where I am. When he goes past, you feel inferior. Especially when he rode up a hill overtaking me, no handed to take his overlayer off.
   
   They're a different breed.

   There was one time I was riding into work and I saw him riding ahead of me and I was giving it all I could to catch him. We were on a good sized hill and he’s calmly riding at 5/10th unaware of me and I’m pushing 10/10’s. I was slowly catching up to him and then I realized that when I catch up to him I would be 100% gassed. I would have to spin in my granny gear and I wouldn’t even be able to talk or say hi.

   It's mind blowing to me how much faster those dudes are compared to mere mortals. Especially MVDP in this year's Cx racing. He's crushing the entire field - OF OTHER ELITE CYCLISTS - by over a minute at times in a Cx race. Like, everyone in that race is a phenomenal cyclist and he is just chewing them up without issue (until yesterday).

   I rode with tyler hamilton, by accident, for about a mile, 20 years ago. I was in Lucca, Italy, riding with some very fit friends. and I was in good shape, my friends were in better shape than me. Out of this world fast is what I would call it. Unless you’ve ridden with a pro or been to a euro pro race it's hard to comprehend.

   This. You have to see it irl to believe the speed. To see it live is stunning, to try and keep up is soul crushing. I’ve ridden with (or witnessed) Olympians, World Champions, GT winners (roadies, MTB, trackies)…their speed is truly jaw dropping.
