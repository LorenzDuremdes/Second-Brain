   Alex Dowsett rides locally to where I am. When he goes past, you feel inferior. Especially when he rode up a hill overtaking me, no handed to take his overlayer off.
   
   They're a different breed.

   There was one time I was riding into work and I saw him riding ahead of me and I was giving it all I could to catch him. We were on a good sized hill and he’s calmly riding at 5/10th unaware of me and I’m pushing 10/10’s. I was slowly catching up to him and then I realized that when I catch up to him I would be 100% gassed. I would have to spin in my granny gear and I wouldn’t even be able to talk or say hi.
2. [What makes you look at a cyclist and think "damn, they're good"?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/1kjkmek/what_makes_you_look_at_a_cyclist_and_think_damn/)
	1. Seeing someone pulling away without breaking a sweat while I am deep in Z7.
	2. There’s a guy like this on my Wed. night ride. He can crank it to 10 whenever he wants but he’s super cool. He’ll go back to sweep and the come back up front to keep pulling. I’m working hard just to draft behind him.
	3. Yeah was gonna basically say this, it's like seeing a red tailed hawk. You don't have to be up close, you can see the way theyre moving from 200 yards away and still be able to tell what it is, and think "yep not catching them"
	4. Good riders make going fast look effortless
	5. In Scotland, I saw someone up ahead and even from a distance they looked good. Tall, lean but very defined legs. When I got closer I spotted a Great Britain kit. I was sat behind him (in my car, on the flat) doing nearly 30mph!! I can't remember what bike he had but he looked so aero and controlled. I've no idea if it was a pro or not but he was definitely good
	6. There are certain people who look stable as they push, can increase speed by cadence alone without bouncing or having to stand up, or look like they are on rails.
	7. Specifically, I think it's for strength, hip flexion and a particular ankle angle. Really good looking riders are able to effortlessly support their upper body low over the bars, with a hinge like bend at the hips while maintaining a strong ankle angle.

   It's mind blowing to me how much faster those dudes are compared to mere mortals. Especially MVDP in this year's Cx racing. He's crushing the entire field - OF OTHER ELITE CYCLISTS - by over a minute at times in a Cx race. Like, everyone in that race is a phenomenal cyclist and he is just chewing them up without issue (until yesterday).

   I rode with tyler hamilton, by accident, for about a mile, 20 years ago. I was in Lucca, Italy, riding with some very fit friends. and I was in good shape, my friends were in better shape than me. Out of this world fast is what I would call it. Unless you’ve ridden with a pro or been to a euro pro race it's hard to comprehend.

   This. You have to see it irl to believe the speed. To see it live is stunning, to try and keep up is soul crushing. I’ve ridden with (or witnessed) Olympians, World Champions, GT winners (roadies, MTB, trackies)…their speed is truly jaw dropping.

   Used to ride with a couple pros when I lived in NM. Always a humbling experience. Never could figure out what was worse. Them hitting the gas on a climb while I was giving my all and they drop me like they're fresh -or- putting in 50-60mi and being well done and hear them talking about doing another 50.
