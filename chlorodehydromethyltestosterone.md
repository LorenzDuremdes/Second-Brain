1. Fig. 1 presents a spectacular example, the [[performance-enhancing substance|drug]] effects on a woman shot-putter, and shows how her performance was reproducibly increased by ~2 m after daily intake of two tablets (10 mg) of Oral-Turinabol for only 11 weeks.^[[Hormonal doping and androgenization of athletes: a secret program of the German Democratic Republic government -- Franke and Berendonk 43 (7): 1262 -- Clinical Chemistry (archive.org)](https://web.archive.org/web/20110514103044/http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/content/full/43/7/1262)]
	1. Without the [[performance-enhancing substance|drug]], she could not reach 18 m but when taking the [[performance-enhancing substance|drug]], she improved her world record once more, to 20.10 m. (c) 1972.
	2. She took even more of the [[anabolic-androgenic steroid|androgenic hormone]], with daily dosages of up to 7 tablets per day (35 mg), in four cycles, for a total androgenic load of 1450 mg for the year. This led to her top performances in the winter indoor season _(left curve)_ as well as in the summer _(right curve)_ and another personal best (20.22 m)
	3. Also, after 4 years of systematic androgenization, her basic strength level even when not taking the [[performance-enhancing substance|drug]] had also increased by ~1 m, indicative of a residual effect.
4. **1976 Summer Olympics**: East Germany surpassed all expectations for a middle-sized nation by finishing with the second most gold medals in total. The East German women's swimming team won all but two gold medals. Swimmer Kornelia Ender won four gold medals and a silver medal. However, the GDR's achievements were later fundamentally undermined by the exposure of a serious and systematic scheme of doping by the East German sporting authorities.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Summer_Olympics#cite_note-26] It was later revealed that after injecting athletes with performance-boosting drugs at the Montreal Olympics, East German officials dumped the leftover serum and syringes in the Saint Lawrence River.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Summer_Olympics#cite_note-27]

## pharmacokinetics
1. how does chlorodehydromethyltestosterone (Oral Turinabol) increase endurance?
	1. [[erythropoiesis]] (RBC)
2. 20 mg for endurance with an ~8 week cycle length[https://web.archive.org/web/20181011004425/http://www.buildbody.org.ua/farmakologiya/oral-turinabol]
