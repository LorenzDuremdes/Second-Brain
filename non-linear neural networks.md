1. [[noise (spectral phenomenon)]] → non-linear neural networks
	1. [[noise (spectral phenomenon)]] generally hinders neural performance, but recent studies show, in dynamical non-linear neural networks, this statement does not always hold true.
	2. current research suggests that neuronal [[noise (spectral phenomenon)]] is beneficial to non-linear or complex neural networks up until optimal value.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuronal_noise#cite_note-parnas-8]
