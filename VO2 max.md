1. aerobic capacity (synonym); VO2 max
2. VO2 max = millilitres of [[oxygen]] per kilogram of body mass per minute^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max#Expression]^[**see also**: The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 19]
	1. mL/(kg·min)
3. the supply factors are usually more likely to be limiting VO2 max
	1. supply is the transport of [[oxygen]] from the [[lungs]] to the [[mitochondria]] (combining pulmonary function, [[cardiac output]], [[blood volume]], and [[capillary]] density of the [[skeletal muscle]]) while demand is the rate at which the [[mitochondria]] can reduce [[oxygen]] in the process of [[oxidative phosphorylation]].^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max#cite_note-bassett1-25]
4. body weight → VO2 max
	1. reducing your body weight increases VO2 max (if you don't lose/less proportional reduction in VO2 max)
5. high-level amateur (VO2max) ≈ 70 ml/kg/min^[Laursen et al. (2002)]^[The Time-Crunched Cyclist: Race-Winning Fitness in 6 Hours a Week, 3rd Edition, p. 11]

# Z5 training
1. ◇it could perhaps be better to increase duration (VO2 max)
	1. e.g. being able to hold Z5 longer due to e.g. more replenished [[glycogen]] + less SNS fatigue (latter exponential decay)

# [[functional threshold power]]
1. VO2 max = 16.6 + (8.87 · 5-min. relative power output)^[[https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/ijspp/17/1/article-p9.xml](https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/ijspp/17/1/article-p9.xml)]

VO2 max (mL/min./kg) = 10.97 · PPO (W/kg) + 2.598^[[Allometric scaling of peak power output accurately predicts time trial performance and maximal oxygen consumption in trained cyclists (2011)](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/46/1/36.info)]^[[https://forum.intervals.icu/t/pvo2max-in-relation-to-pftp/1042/15](https://forum.intervals.icu/t/pvo2max-in-relation-to-pftp/1042/15) (David Tinker)]
	1. PPO = peak power output from continuous ramp test 20w/min increase
	2. VO2 max (L/min) = 0.01141 x PPO + 0.435
