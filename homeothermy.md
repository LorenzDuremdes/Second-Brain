1. homeothermy; [[thermoregulation]] that maintains a stable internal body [[temperature]] regardless of external influence
   
   **homeothermy vs. [[endotherm]]**
   
   Homeotherms are not necessarily endothermic. Some homeotherms may maintain constant body temperatures through behavioral mechanisms alone, i.e., behavioral [[thermoregulation]]. Many reptiles use this strategy. For example, desert lizards are remarkable in that they maintain near-constant activity temperatures that are often within a degree or two of their lethal critical temperatures.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeothermy]
