1. nutrition periodization; the demands on our bodies vary, it follows that our nutrition to fuel our bodies should vary as well^[[Understanding Nutrition Periodization (trainingpeaks.com)](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/understanding-nutrition-periodization/)]
2. why do you like to consume more carbohydrates while riding even if it has no performance gains (e.g. short rides)?
	1. On a single ride, eh. Not so much of an issue. However if you are training 13-15 hours a week, it goes beyond a “suggestion” to ingest 80+ an hour. You WILL deplete your stores and you WILL burn out quickly. I for one also dont want to eat a couple 1200cal meals after a ride either. YMMV but I avg. 14hrs a week and I work in construction 10hrs a day (electrician) so on a normal training day just to maintain weight I’m eating 4000+cals a day. I need some of that from the straight sugary goodness bottle or I’m slammin a meal thats a lot larger than i’d like to eat if I want to execute a training block effectively.^[https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/why-has-adding-a-lot-more-carbs-not-had-a-noticeable-impact/92694/37?u=lorenz_duremdes]
		1. prevent [[reactive hypoglycemia]]
		2. +1 on this. Fueling during a ride is as much (or more) about the next ride and post ride meals as it is about the current ride. If riding even moderately hard, there is no way to keep up with calorie burn while on the bike, you are just trying to come off the bike with a smaller deficit.
3. how do you personally like to periodize your nutrition + why
	1. eat more on overload days and less on maintenance/recovery days rather than trying to match things on the same day to perhaps improve adaptations
	2. even vs. 1 day deficit · 6 days surplus (nutrition periodization)
		1. the latter might be more effective (especially when combining it with proper [[sports periodization]] e.g. ~70% FTP on day 1)?

![[Table 3 Theoretical overview of the ‘fuel for the work required’ model.png]]
The model is presented for an elite endurance athlete (e.g. road cyclist) who trains once per day on 4 consecutive days where each session commences at 10:00 am each day. In this example, the athlete has four main feeding points and the CHO content of each timepoint is colour coded according to a red, amber or green (RAG) rating that represents low, medium and high CHO intake. Note that we have not prescribed specific CHO quantities and deliberately chose a RAG rating so as to highlight the necessity for flexibility in relation to athlete history, training status and specific training goals, etc. Rather, the model is simply presented to illustrate how train-low paradigms can be amalgamated to adjust CHO availability day-by-day and meal-by-meal according to the demands of the specific training session across the 4-day training block. In this example, high CHO intake is advised before, during and after the training session on day 1 (e.g. ‘train high’), but reduced in the evening meal to facilitate [[sleep]] low and train low for a lower-intensity session on day 2 (i.e. likely commenced with reduced muscle [[glycogen]] and withholding or reducing CHO content of the pre-training meal). Following completion of the second training session, high CHO availability is prescribed for the remainder of day 2 so as to promote [[glycogen]] storage in preparation for a higher absolute workload and intensity on day 3. Given that day 4 is a designated recovery day of much lower duration and intensity, CHO intake is then reduced in the evening of day 3 and breakfast of day 4, but is then increased throughout the remainder of day 4 in order to prepare for another 4-day training block. The model should be adjusted according to the number of feeding points and training sessions that are to be undertaken on each day, e.g. a marathon runner^[[Sherman WM, Wimer GS. Insufficient dietary carbohydrate during training? Does it impair athletic performance? Int J Sport Nutr. 1991;1:28–44.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-018-0867-7#ref-CR7)]] would have a different CHO periodization model than a cyclist. Careful day-to-day periodization in a meal-by-meal manner (as opposed to chronic periods of CHO restriction or CHO feeding) is likely to maintain metabolic flexibility and still allow the completion of high-intensity and prolonged duration workloads on heavy training days, e.g. interval-type sessions undertaken above [[lactate threshold]]. Intuitively, ‘train low’ may be best left to those training sessions that are not CHO-dependent and where the intensity and duration is not likely to be compromised by reduced CHO availability (e.g. steady-state-type training sessions performed at intensities below the [[lactate threshold]]). Additionally, the model may also provide a framework to aid body mass loss given that train-low sessions on lower-intensity training days may allow for the creation of [[energy]] deficits without negating training intensity
