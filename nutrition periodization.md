1. [[nutrition]] periodization; the demands on our bodies vary, it follows that our nutrition to fuel our bodies should vary as well^[[Understanding Nutrition Periodization (trainingpeaks.com)](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/understanding-nutrition-periodization/)]
2. why do you like to consume more carbohydrates while riding even if it has no performance gains (e.g. short rides)?
	1. On a single ride, eh. Not so much of an issue. However if you are training 13-15 hours a week, it goes beyond a “suggestion” to ingest 80+ an hour. You WILL deplete your stores and you WILL burn out quickly. I for one also dont want to eat a couple 1200cal meals after a ride either. YMMV but I avg. 14hrs a week and I work in construction 10hrs a day (electrician) so on a normal training day just to maintain weight I’m eating 4000+cals a day. I need some of that from the straight sugary goodness bottle or I’m slammin a meal thats a lot larger than i’d like to eat if I want to execute a training block effectively.^[https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/why-has-adding-a-lot-more-carbs-not-had-a-noticeable-impact/92694/37?u=lorenz_duremdes]
		1. prevent [[reactive hypoglycemia]]
		2. +1 on this. Fueling during a ride is as much (or more) about the next ride and post ride meals as it is about the current ride. If riding even moderately hard, there is no way to keep up with [[calorie]] burn while on the bike, you are just trying to come off the bike with a smaller deficit.
3. how do you personally like to periodize your nutrition + why
	1. eat more on overload days and less on maintenance/recovery days rather than trying to match things on the same day to perhaps improve adaptations
	2. even vs. 1 day deficit · 6 days surplus (nutrition periodization)
		1. the latter might be more effective (especially when combining it with proper [[sports periodization]] e.g. ~70% FTP on day 1)?

# [[dieting]]
1. Is it better to cut, bulk, or be in an isocaloric diet during a rest/recovery day (endurance athletes)?
	1. **Perplexity AI**
	   For endurance athletes, rest or recovery days are crucial for allowing the body to repair and rebuild after intense training. The choice between cutting, bulking, or maintaining an isocaloric diet on these days depends on your overall goals (e.g., [[physical fitness|performance]], [[cutting (diet)|fat loss]], or [[muscle hypertrophy|muscle gain]]) and current [[sports periodization|training phase]]. However, for most [[endurance training|endurance athletes]] focused on performance and recovery, an [[isocaloric diet|isocaloric]] or slightly reduced calorie intake is generally the best approach.
	   
	   **Why an Isocaloric Diet is Optimal on Rest Days**
		1. **Support Recovery**: Even on rest days, your body continues to repair [[muscle]] damage and replenish [[glycogen]] stores. Maintaining a balanced intake of [[macronutrients]]—especially [[carbohydrate|carbohydrates]] and [[protein]]—is essential for optimizing recovery and preparing for future training sessions[1](https://kellyjonesnutrition.com/what-to-eat-on-rest-days-vs-training-days/)[2](https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/how-to-turn-hard-work-into-results-with-recovery/)[6](https://www.triathlete.com/nutrition/recovery-day-heres-how-to-optimize-your-nutrition/).
		2. **Avoid Over-Restriction**: Cutting calories significantly on rest days can hinder recovery by [[low energy availability|depriving your body of the energy and nutrients it needs to repair tissues and restore glycogen levels]][3](https://oleus.com/blogs/general/rest-days-for-runners-your-complete-guide-to-recovery-peak-performance)[6](https://www.triathlete.com/nutrition/recovery-day-heres-how-to-optimize-your-nutrition/).
		3. **Prevent Excess Fat Gain**: Bulking (eating in a calorie surplus) is generally unnecessary for endurance athletes unless you are specifically aiming to gain weight or muscle mass. Overeating on rest days can lead to unwanted fat gain without providing additional recovery benefits[4](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/bulking-vs-cutting)[9](https://www.nike.com/nl/en/a/bulking-vs-cutting-benefits).
	   **Macronutrient Recommendations**
		- **Protein**: Protein intake should remain consistent with training days to support muscle repair. Aim for 0.6–0.8 grams of protein per pound of body weight spread throughout the day[6](https://www.triathlete.com/nutrition/recovery-day-heres-how-to-optimize-your-nutrition/)[8](https://stevielynrd.com/blog/the-art-of-the-rest-day).
		- **Carbohydrates**: Carbohydrate needs may be slightly reduced compared to training days but should still be sufficient to replenish glycogen stores. Intake typically ranges from 0.5–2.0 grams per pound of body weight, depending on weekly training volume[6](https://www.triathlete.com/nutrition/recovery-day-heres-how-to-optimize-your-nutrition/)[7](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/the-best-recovery-practices-for-endurance-athletes/).
		- **Fats**: Healthy fats can provide sustained energy and support overall health but should not dominate the diet on rest days.
	  **Practical Tips for Rest Day Nutrition**
		- Focus on balanced meals with lean proteins, complex carbohydrates (e.g., whole grains, fruits, vegetables), and healthy fats (e.g., nuts, seeds, avocados)[3](https://oleus.com/blogs/general/rest-days-for-runners-your-complete-guide-to-recovery-peak-performance)[8](https://stevielynrd.com/blog/the-art-of-the-rest-day).
		- Stay hydrated and consider adding [[electrolyte|electrolytes]] if needed[8](https://stevielynrd.com/blog/the-art-of-the-rest-day).
		- Avoid overindulging in "treats" unless they fit within your overall caloric needs.
	  **When Cutting or Bulking Might Be Considered**
		- **Cutting**: If fat loss is a priority, you can create a slight calorie deficit (e.g., 200–300 calories) on rest days while still prioritizing nutrient-dense foods to support recovery.
		- **Bulking**: If muscle gain is a goal, a small calorie surplus can be maintained even on rest days, but this approach is more relevant for [[strength training|strength athletes]] than endurance athletes[4](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/bulking-vs-cutting)[9](https://www.nike.com/nl/en/a/bulking-vs-cutting-benefits).
		  
	  In summary, an isocaloric diet that emphasizes balanced macronutrients is generally the best choice for endurance athletes during rest days. This approach ensures adequate recovery while avoiding unnecessary calorie restriction or surplus that could hinder performance or lead to fat gain.

# [[glycogen threshold]]
## [[microcycle]]
The studies reviewed thus far have typically adopted matched work exercise protocols whereby CHO availability is manipulated prior to training sessions consisting of identical intensity, duration and work performed. More recently, we also adopted an experimental design in which participants completed an exhaustive exercise capacity test in conditions of high or low pre-exercise muscle [[glycogen]] (600 and 300 mmol/kg dw, respectively)^[[Impey SG, Hammond KM, Shepherd SO, Sharples AP, Stewart C, Limb M, Smith K, Philp A, Jeromson S, Hamilton DL, Close GL, Morton JP. Fuel for the work required: a practical approach to amalgamating train-low paradigms for endurance athletes. Physiol Rep. 2016;4:e12803.](https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.14814/phy2.12803)]]. **All participants cycled for longer in the high trial versus the low trial, with average exercise capacity increased by 60 min**. We observed identical [[cell signaling|cell signalling]] and post-exercise [[gene expression|gene responses]] between trials (e.g. AMPK-PGC-1α) despite the completion of less work performed in the low [[glycogen]] trial. However, it is acknowledged that to stimulate other endurance-related adaptations (e.g. central changes such as [[ventricular hypertrophy|cardiac hypertrophy]]), high [[glycogen]] conditions would be superior, given that it would allow for the completion of more work performed and, of course, an elevated [[heart rate]] for a much longer training duration. Moreover, at the muscular level it appears that commencing exercise with high muscle [[glycogen]] requires the completion of considerably more work in order to elicit comparable [[cell signaling|cell signalling]] and muscle remodelling responses than those occurring when exercise is commenced with low muscle [[glycogen]]. In this situation, it is suggested that subjects eventually surpass a critical level of [[glycogen]] depletion, thereby completing a proportion of exercise within the [[glycogen]] threshold required to stimulate [[cell signaling|cell signalling]]. Given that elite endurance athletes rarely complete identical sessions or train with maximal intensity (or to exhaustion) on consecutive training sessions, either within or between days, such data support the concept of ‘fuelling for the work required’, whereby CHO availability is adjusted in accordance with the demands of the specific training session to be completed. In this way, absolute daily CHO intake and distribution can be modified so that key sessions are performed within or close to the suggested muscle [[glycogen]] threshold. As initially alluded to by Sherman et al.^[[Sherman WM, Costill DL, Fink WJ, Miller JM. Effect of exercise-diet manipulation on muscle glycogen and its subsequent utilization during performance. Int J Sports Med. 1981;2:114–8.](https://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-2008-1034594)], the question that emerges therefore is not how much an athlete can super-compensate their [[glycogen]] stores but rather does the athlete’s diet contain enough CHO to maintain training intensity while also creating a consistent metabolic milieu that is conducive to facilitating training adaptations. Using the [[sport]] of [[road cycling]], we present a theoretical overview of the model in Table^[[Table 4 | Fuel for the Work Required: A Theoretical Framework for Carbohydrate Periodization and the Glycogen Threshold Hypothesis | Sports Medicine (springer.com)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-018-0867-7/tables/4)]
![[Table 3 Theoretical overview of the ‘fuel for the work required’ model.png]]
The model is presented for an elite endurance athlete (e.g. road cyclist) who trains once per day on 4 consecutive days where each session commences at 10:00 am each day. In this example, the athlete has four main feeding points and the CHO content of each timepoint is colour coded according to a red, amber or green (RAG) rating that represents low, medium and high CHO intake. Note that we have not prescribed specific CHO quantities and deliberately chose a RAG rating so as to highlight the necessity for flexibility in relation to athlete history, training status and specific training goals, etc. Rather, the model is simply presented to illustrate how train-low paradigms can be amalgamated to adjust CHO availability day-by-day and meal-by-meal according to the demands of the specific training session across the 4-day training block. In this example, high CHO intake is advised before, during and after the training session on day 1 (e.g. ‘train high’), but reduced in the evening meal to facilitate [[sleep]] low and train low for a lower-intensity session on day 2 (i.e. likely commenced with reduced muscle [[glycogen]] and withholding or reducing CHO content of the pre-training meal). Following completion of the second training session, high CHO availability is prescribed for the remainder of day 2 so as to promote [[glycogen]] storage in preparation for a higher absolute workload and intensity on day 3. Given that day 4 is a designated recovery day of much lower duration and intensity, CHO intake is then reduced in the evening of day 3 and breakfast of day 4, but is then increased throughout the remainder of day 4 in order to prepare for another 4-day training block. The model should be adjusted according to the number of feeding points and training sessions that are to be undertaken on each day, e.g. a marathon runner^[[Sherman WM, Wimer GS. Insufficient dietary carbohydrate during training? Does it impair athletic performance? Int J Sport Nutr. 1991;1:28–44.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-018-0867-7#ref-CR7)]] would have a different CHO periodization model than a cyclist. Careful day-to-day periodization in a meal-by-meal manner (as opposed to chronic periods of CHO restriction or CHO feeding) is likely to maintain metabolic flexibility and still allow the completion of high-intensity and prolonged duration workloads on heavy training days, e.g. interval-type sessions undertaken above [[lactate threshold]]. Intuitively, ‘train low’ may be best left to those training sessions that are not CHO-dependent and where the intensity and duration is not likely to be compromised by reduced CHO availability (e.g. steady-state-type training sessions performed at intensities below the [[lactate threshold]]). Additionally, the model may also provide a framework to aid body mass loss given that train-low sessions on lower-intensity training days may allow for the creation of [[energy]] deficits without negating training intensity

3. what does the "fuel for the work required paradigm" regard as intensities usually fitting for "train-low days"?
	1. below [[lactate threshold]] (see their example table)^[[Table 4 | Fuel for the Work Required: A Theoretical Framework for Carbohydrate Periodization and the Glycogen Threshold Hypothesis | Sports Medicine (springer.com)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-018-0867-7/tables/4)]
4. what would the "fuel for the work required paradigm" perhaps say how many carbohydrates should be distributed pre- vs. post-workout?
	1. as little as possible pre-workout and as much as possible post-workout
		1. this could maximize adaptations (e.g. [[glycogen threshold]]) while also maximizing recovery (and avoiding accumulative fatigue)/adaptations post-workout
		2. perhaps also more easily avoids the problem of overfueling (an extreme example would be consuming all the carbohydrates immediately after waking up and doing the workout just before going to bed → the opposite scenario could avoid this (although still suboptimal)
			1. 1. like how you can't store excess sleep (but can accumulate sleep debt)
5. acute ingestion of carbohydrates → [[fatty acid metabolism|rate of fat oxidation]] during exercise
	1. Ingestion of [[carbohydrate]] in the hours before or on commencement of exercise reduces the [[fatty acid metabolism|rate of fat oxidation]] significantly compared with fasted conditions, whereas fasting longer than 6 h optimizes [[fat]] oxidation. [[Fat]] oxidation rates have been shown to decrease after ingestion of high-[[fat]] diets, partly as a result of decreased [[glycogen]] stores and partly because of adaptations at the muscle level.^[[Optimizing Fat Oxidation Through Exercise and Diet, Juul Achten, PhD, and Asker E. Jeukendrup, PhD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15212756/)]
6. can you consume carbohydrates intra-workout according to the "fuel for the work required paradigm"?
	1. As opposed to chronic periods of CHO restriction, this model suggests that CHO availability should be manipulated day-to-day and meal-by-meal according to the intensity, duration and specific training goals. With this in mind, we define CHO availability as the sum of the endogenous (i.e., muscle and [[liver]] [[glycogen]]) and exogenous CHO (i.e. CHO consumed before and/or during exercise) that is available to sustain the required training intensity and duration. According to this definition, it is possible to have insufficient CHO availability (even if exercise is commenced with high pre-exercise muscle [[glycogen]] stores) if an inadequate dose of CHO is consumed during exercise to sustain the desired workload. Alternatively, **it is possible to commence exercise with reduced muscle [[glycogen]] yet still be considered to have sufficient CHO availability if the exogenous CHO consumed during exercise permits the completion of the required training intensity and duration**.^[[Fuel for the Work Required: A Theoretical Framework for Carbohydrate Periodization and the Glycogen Threshold Hypothesis | Sports Medicine (springer.com)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-018-0867-7)]

### session
7. what [[trade-off]] has to be made when considering applying [[glycogen threshold]] and train-low/high?
	1. it's probably not as beneficial to apply it when being unable to finish a workout (and e.g. decreasing CTL) i.e. plan [[glycogen threshold]] training after programming e.g. TSS distribution

#### twice-a-day training
8. how could you incorporate [[glycogen threshold]] when training twice a day?
	1. train-high in the morning (including post-workout [[carbohydrate]] consumption) > eat little in between > train-low in the afternoon (as more [[energy]] comes from [[fat]] as well in the afternoon) > consume lots of carbohydrates post-workout
9. high vs. low carbohydrates between sessions on same day + why
	1. depends on intensity, but if the train-high day is the following day, it might perhaps make more sense to distribute more carbohydrates post-second-workout (and perhaps inducing more adaptations i.e. [[glycogen threshold]]) while total carbohydrates per 24 hour is the same

# carbohydrates
10. how do you personally like to program train-low sessions while still getting enough carbohydrates?
	1. eat as much carbohydrates as possible around the workout on train-high days and have your last meal (at least with carbohydrates) as far as possible before your train-low session (+ not consuming carbohydrates pre/intra-workout) e.g. having your evening meal at 16:00 and nothing else afterward
