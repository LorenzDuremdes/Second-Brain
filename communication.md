	communication is one of those delightful things that work only in practice; in theory it’s impossible

	1. due to e.g. noise → difficulty attaining 100% accuracy

		e.g.:

		Imagine two generals, on opposite sides of a valley that contains their common enemy, attempting to coordinate an attack. Only by perfect synchronization will they succeed; for either to attack alone is suicide. What’s worse, any messages from one general to the other must be delivered by hand across the very terrain that contains the enemy, meaning there’s a chance that any given message will never arrive.

		The first general, say, suggests a [[time]] for the attack, but won’t dare go for it unless he knows for sure that his comrade is moving, too. The second general receives the orders and sends back a confirmation—but won’t dare attack unless he knows that the first general received that confirmation (since otherwise the first general won’t be going). The first general receives the confirmation—but won’t attack until he’s certain that the second general knows he did. **Following this chain of logic requires an infinite series of messages**, and obviously that won’t do^[Algorithms to Live By: The [[Computer Science]] of [[Human]] Decisions, p. 221]
