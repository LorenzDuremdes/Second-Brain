1. Venturi effect; the reduction in fluid pressure that results when a fluid flows through a constricted section (or choke) of a pipe^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venturi_effect]
	1. any gain in kinetic energy a fluid may attain by its increased velocity through a constriction is balanced by a drop in pressure
2. the static pressure in the first measuring tube (1) is higher than at the second (2), and the fluid speed at "1" is lower than at "2", because the cross-sectional area at "1" is greater than at "2"^[By HappyApple - Own work, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=796111]
