1. What is the max prompt length in terms of words that I can provide, which [[ChatGPT]] can process?
	1. As an AI [[language]] model, [[ChatGPT]] can process a maximum of 4096 tokens in a single input. Tokens can be as short as one character or as long as one word. The number of words that can fit within the 4096-token limit depends on the length and complexity of the words. Keep in mind that both your prompt and the generated response must fit within this limit, so the more words you include in your prompt, the fewer tokens will be available for the response. To ensure a comprehensive response, it is advisable to keep your prompt concise and focused.
2. Why is there a 4096-token limit?
	1. The 4096-token limit is a result of the underlying architecture and design of the GPT [[language]] model, specifically GPT-3, which is the basis for [[ChatGPT]]. This limit is primarily imposed by hardware constraints, such as [[memory]] limitations on the Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) used for training and running the model.
	   
	   When training deep learning models like GPT-3, large amounts of [[memory]] are needed to store the intermediate states and activations of the neural network. As the context window (the number of tokens that can be processed at once) increases, the [[memory]] requirements grow exponentially. To strike a balance between the model's performance and computational efficiency, the creators of GPT-3 set a fixed context window size of 4096 tokens. This limit allows the model to handle reasonably long inputs and outputs while keeping the [[memory]] and computational requirements within manageable levels.
	   2. How many tokens does the aformentioned response contain?
		   1. The aforementioned response contains 125 tokens.
