1. minimum spanning tree; a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree]
2. A planar graph and its minimum spanning tree. Each edge is labeled with its weight, which here is roughly proportional to its length.^[By No machine-readable author provided.
