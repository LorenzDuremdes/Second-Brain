1. cadherins; a type of [[cell adhesion molecule]] (CAM) that is important in the formation of adherens junctions to bind cells with each other.^[[Cadherin - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadherin#cite_note-:3-1)]
2. cadherins (etymology); calcium-dependent adhesion
3. **Principal interactions of structural proteins at cadherin-based [[adherens junction]]. Actin filaments are linked to [[α-actinin]] and to [[membrane]] through vinculin. The head domain of vinculin associates to E-cadherin via α-, β-, and γ-catenins. The tail domain of vinculin binds to [[membrane]] lipids and to actin filaments.**^[By Mariana Ruiz LadyofHats - i did the diagram myself based on the information found on this websites:[1], [2], ISBN 9514269306/html/x477.html, [3], [4],[5], [6], [7], and [8], Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=756087]
