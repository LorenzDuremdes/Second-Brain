1. [[fat]] hydrogenation; the process of combining unsaturated fat with hydrogen in order to partially or completely convert it into saturated fat^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_hydrogenation]
2. It was discovered that, if you heat oil in the presence of hydrogen gas at high pressure, you can modify its chemical structure and change its melting properties. If you hydrogenate the oil fully, you get fat that’s hard like ice. But if you only _partially_ hydrogenate, you can make any melting profile you like, which makes it possible to produce a fat that’s solid at room temperature but still easy to spread out of the fridge.^[Ultra-Processed People The Science Behind the Food That Isnt Food (Chris van Tulleken), p. 27–28]
