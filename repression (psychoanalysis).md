1. repression ([[psychoanalysis]]); a key concept of [[psychoanalysis]], where it is understood as a [[defense mechanism]] that "ensures that what is unacceptable to the conscious [[mind]], and would if recalled arouse [[anxiety]], is prevented from entering into it."^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repression_(psychoanalysis)#cite_note-1]
2. there has been debate as to whether (or how often) [[memory]] repression really occurs^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repression_(psychoanalysis)#cite_note-McNally2004-3] and mainstream [[psychology]] holds that true [[memory]] repression occurs only very rarely.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repression_(psychoanalysis)#cite_note-4]
3. A 2020 meta-analysis of 25 studies examined the evidence that active [[memory]] suppression actually leads to decreased [[memory]]. It was found that in people with a repressive [[coping]] strategy, the willful avoidance of remembering certain [[memory]] contents leads to a significant reduction in [[memory]] performance for these contents. In addition, healthy people were better able to do this than anxious or depressed people. These results indicate that forgetting induced by suppression is a hallmark of mental wellbeing.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repression_(psychoanalysis)#cite_note-24]
