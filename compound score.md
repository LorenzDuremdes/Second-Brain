1. compound score ([[road cycling]]) = absolute power · w/kg^[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361643363_The_Compound_Score_in_elite_road_cycling]
	1. The compound score is absolute power (w) x relative power (w/kg) for a given duration (here 5 minutes). It has been found to be more predictive than 5m absolute or relative power alone of pro-continental U23 one day racing success^[Intervals.icu]
	2. what about w/kg · w/CdA ([[time trial]])?
		1. e.g. both can have the same w/CdA but one has a higher w/kg e.g. requiring less watts to accelerate (e.g. corners, ascending)
