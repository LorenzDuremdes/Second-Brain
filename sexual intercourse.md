# microsociology
1. 'good' sexual intercourse is all about communication (rather than e.g. techniques)^[https://qr.ae/pGzyut, [[Franklin Veaux]]]
	1. e.g. each other's desires, bodies, turn-offs

# biopsychology
1. sexual [[arousal]] ↮ sexual desire^[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where [[Happiness]] Comes from, and Why, p. 121]
	1. the former means we are physically and mentally able to have [[sex]], the latter means we want to

## [[arousal]]
1. what [[sex]] hormone seems to be most clearly linked to [[arousal]]?^[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where [[Happiness]] Comes from, and Why, p. 124]
	1. [[testosterone]]

### [[women]]
1. [[testosterone]] → [[arousal]] ([[women]])^[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where [[Happiness]] Comes from, and Why, p. 124]^[Sarrel, P. M., ‘Effects of hormone replacement therapy on sexual psychophysiology and behavior in postmenopause’, Journal of [[Women]]’s [[Health]] and Gender-Based Medicine, 2000, 9(1, Supplement 1), pp. 25–32]
	1. menopausal [[women]] undergoing hormone replacement therapy, which involves [[testosterone]], regularly report increased [[arousal]]

# [[men]] + [[women]]
## [[men]] ↮ [[women]]
1. [[women]] having higher sexual requirements is related to "[[Occam's razor]]"
	1. lower probability of occurrence

# [[neuroscience]]
1. [[pleasure]] · [[brain]] networks · method ↔ state^[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4939-6418-5_18]

2. can sexual triggers (e.g. erection) becaused without involvement of the [[brain]]? + how^[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where [[Happiness]] Comes from, and Why, p. 126]
	1. yes e.g. the spinal cord

		the thrumming vibrations experienced while sitting on a bus may set off these reflexive [[arousal]] systems, which process them as a form of intimate touch from an interested partner, rather than the inevitable result of a large vehicle’s internal combustion engine

## [[neuropsychology]]
1. [[secondary somatosensory cortex]] (physical intimacy) (([[neurophysiology]])); adds the 'pleasurable' element^[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where [[Happiness]] Comes from, and Why, p. 122]^[Cazala, F., N. Vienney and S. Stoléru, ‘The cortical sensory representation of genitalia in [[women]] and [[men]]: a systematic review’, Socioaffective [[Neuroscience]] and [[Psychology]], 2015, 5, p. 10.3402/snp. v5.26428.]

### sexual desire
1. sexual desire ([[neurophysiology]], major)^[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where [[Happiness]] Comes from, and Why, p. 126]
	1. mostly processed in the temporal lobe

		because much of the [[limbic system]] is comprised of temporal lobe areas, especially the [[amygdala]] and [[hippocampus]]

### sexual [[arousal]]
1. if the cause of [[arousal]] is something we see, there’s corresponding activity in the **[[extrastriate body area]]**^[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where [[Happiness]] Comes from, and Why, p. 122–123]
2. **[[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]]** (sexual [[arousal]]); activates _via_ many important and diverse connections the other [[brain]] regions involved in [[arousal]]^[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where [[Happiness]] Comes from, and Why, p. 123]
	1. it also diverts our attention, via the [[bottom-up]] system, to the cause of the [[arousal]]
3. [[amygdala]] (specialization during sexual [[arousal]]); determine whether sexual [[arousal]] is 'warranted'^[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where [[Happiness]] Comes from, and Why, p. 123]
	1. A beautiful man or woman lying naked on your bed? Potentially very arousing. Same person lying naked on an operating table, because you’re their surgeon? The [[amygdala]] is what (hopefully) would determine that [[arousal]] is not warranted in this context, despite the similar visual cues.

## hippocampus
1. what could be the advantage of the hippocampus causing memories of sexual intercourse to be more vivid?^[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where [[Happiness]] Comes from, and Why, p. 127]
	1. ensuring we have potentially helpful prior experiences fresh in our [[mind]]

# sexual dysfunction
1. low [[testosterone]] can cause erectile dysfunction in [[men]]

	  increasing [[testosterone]] artificially doesn’t seem to fix the problem^[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where [[Happiness]] Comes from, and Why, p. 124]
	  1. why?
