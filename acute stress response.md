	**possibilities**
	Cortisol, a [[stress]] hormone, was found to be elevated in males during stressful situations. In females, however, cortisol levels were decreased in stressful situations, and instead, an increase in limbic activity was discovered. Many researchers believe that these results underlie the reasons why [[men]] administer a fight-or-flight reaction to [[stress]]; whereas, females have a tend-and-befriend reaction.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping#cite_note-Wang-53]
