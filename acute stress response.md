	**possibilities**
	[[Cortisol]], a [[stress]] hormone, was found to be elevated in males during stressful situations. In females, however, [[cortisol]] levels were decreased in stressful situations, and instead, an increase in limbic activity was discovered. Many researchers believe that these results underlie the reasons why [[men]] administer a fight-or-flight reaction to [[stress]]; whereas, females have a tend-and-befriend reaction.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping#cite_note-Wang-53]
