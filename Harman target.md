3. the Harman Target is more than just what 'average people prefer'. It was also an attempt to simulate the sound an audio engineer would hear with two studio monitors in front of them in a treated room (the cliché ‘as the artist intended)^[[EQ Guide and why everyone should do it (oratory1990 appreciation post) : r/headphones (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/17ymg6s/eq_guide_and_why_everyone_should_do_it/)]
