1. Cladogram (family tree) of a biological group. The last common ancestor is the vertical line stem at the bottom. The blue and red subgroups are clades; each shows its common ancestor stem at the bottom of the subgroup branch. The green subgroup is not a clade; it is a paraphyletic group, because it excludes the blue branch which has descended from the same common ancestor. The green subgroup together with the blue one forms a clade again.^[By Life of Riley - Own work, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=10411343]
