# physiology
1. [[testosterone]] → MEV^[How Much Should I Train by Dr. Mike Israetel and Dr. James Hoffmann, p. 36]
	1. the former decreases the latter
	2. those taking enough steroids have an MEV of 0
2. what could cause MEV to increase as one ages?^[How Much Should I Train by Dr. Mike Israetel and Dr. James Hoffmann, p. 36]
	1. e.g. lower [[testosterone]]

## [[skeletal muscle fiber types]]

### [[fast-twitch muscle fibers type II]]
1. 1. faster-twitch muscle fibers → MEV^[How Much Should I Train by Dr. Mike Israetel and Dr. James Hoffmann, p. 35]
	1. faster twitch fibers tend to exhibit lower MEVs

## sleep
1. sleep → MEV
	1. better sleep lowers the latter
	2. same with optimal nutrition and other recovery modalities

		also increases MRV (beneficial)^[How Much Should I Train by Dr. Mike Israetel and Dr. James Hoffmann, p. 36]
