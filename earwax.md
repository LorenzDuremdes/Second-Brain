	1. What kind of doctor does this ? Who do I look for ?
		1. Most/all doctors, I believe. It's a very simple procedure and you can even buy a kit to do it yourself if you don't want to see a doctor.
			1. I did it myself. Use a medicine syringe like the kind they use to give babies liquid oral medicine. Go one half tap water, one half hydrogen peroxide. Squirt that shit in your ear canal. You'll be surprised the gunk that comes out.
				1. Second this. I went in once to fix a bad earwax clog. The doctor just pumped a bunch of water in my ear several times until all the wax got pushed out. She then said she does it to herself all the time in the shower, and that I should do the same. I'm still nervous to squirt into my ear again though.
