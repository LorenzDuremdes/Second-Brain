1. Earwax forms in the outer third or some of the ear canal, not near the eardrum. So, when there's a buildup right up against the eardrum, it's often the result of failed removal attempts.^[[Got an ear full?

	1. What kind of doctor does this ? Who do I look for ?
		1. Most/all doctors, I believe. It's a very simple procedure and you can even buy a kit to do it yourself if you don't want to see a doctor.
			1. I did it myself. Use a medicine syringe like the kind they use to give babies liquid oral medicine. Go one half tap [[water]], one half hydrogen peroxide. Squirt that shit in your ear canal. You'll be surprised the gunk that comes out.
				1. Second this. I went in once to fix a bad earwax clog. The doctor just pumped a bunch of [[water]] in my ear several times until all the wax got pushed out. She then said she does it to herself all the time in the shower, and that I should do the same. I'm still nervous to squirt into my ear again though.

	1. Why YSK: Ive worked as a medical assistant in urgent cares for 9 years and I've often seen people pay hundreds of dollars for me to do something they could easily do themselves at home. If you have pain obviously that's a different story but if your ear is solely plugged with wax you should pick up some debrox and use that for a day or two to loosen the wax and then get a large plastic syringe or bulb syringe from the store and flush your ear with either plain warm [[water]] or mix with a little hydrogen peroxide. That's literally all we do and people pay wayyy too much money to have us do it.
2. should you stick the syringe into your ear (ear irrigation) + why^[[YSK you shouldn't go to the urgent care to get your ears cleaned, it's cheap/easy to do at home : r/YouShouldKnow (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/jivi85/ysk_you_shouldnt_go_to_the_urgent_care_to_get/)]
