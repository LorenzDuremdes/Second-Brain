1. higher vs. lower frequency (maintenance volume) + why
	1. ◇a higher frequency might be better, because it increases MAV and MRV (and reduces total recovery time for the same load)
		1. why? ◇due to e.g. MPS

# [[road cycling]]
1. how could MV not increase (too much) despite higher distances required at the same intensity ([[road cycling]])?
	1. because MV is probably based on time (TSS) → you are able to go farther distances with the same intensity (same with [[resistance training]] and volume · weight)
