1. higher vs. lower frequency (maintenance volume) + why
	1. ◇a higher frequency might be better, because it increases MAV and MRV (and reduces total recovery time for the same load)
		1. why? ◇due to e.g. MPS

# [[endurance training]]
1. Based on the research reviewed herein, the following recommendations are made to exercise and sport practitioners who strive to maintain the endurance and strength of their athletes and clients. With respect to our recommendations, in the event of uncertainty in the minimal dose needed to maintain performance, we have chosen the more conservative approach. Finally, as noted above, these recommendations should be treated with the utmost caution because of the limited number of studies available, limitations in interpreting the existing studies, and the primary population studied (i.e., mostly the general population).^[[Maintaining Physical Performance: The Minimal Dose of Exerci... : The Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research (lww.com)](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2021/05000/maintaining_physical_performance__the_minimal_dose.35.aspx)]
   
To maintain **short-term endurance** (i.e., maximal bouts of exercise lasting ∼4–8 minutes) in general populations:
   
- Exercise frequency can be reduced to 2 sessions per week, as long as exercise volume and intensity are maintained; or:
- Exercise volume can be reduced by 66% (as little as 13 minutes per session), as long as exercise frequency and intensity are maintained; or:
- Exercise intensity can be reduced to ∼82–87% of HRmax, as long as exercise frequency and volume are maintained.

To maintain **long-term endurance** (i.e., maximal bouts of exercise lasting ∼1–3 hours) in general populations:

- The minimal exercise frequency is not known. Therefore, we conservatively recommend maintaining exercise frequency at or near the individual's typical training level.
- Exercise volume can be reduced by 33% (as little as 26 minutes per session), as long as exercise frequency and intensity are maintained.
- Exercise intensity must be maintained as high as reasonably possible (at least as high as the individual's typical training intensity).

To maintain **V̇o<sub>2</sub> max** in general populations:

- Exercise frequency can be reduced to 2 sessions per week, as long as exercise volume and intensity are maintained; or:
- Exercise volume can be reduced by 66% (as little as 13 minutes per session), as long as exercise frequency and intensity are maintained.
- Exercise intensity must be maintained as high as reasonably possible (at least as high as the individual's typical training intensity).
2. Endurance performance decreases by **4 to 25%** after **3-4 weeks.**^[[The Science of Detraining: How Long You Can Take a Break from the Gym Before You Lose Muscle Mass & Strength • (sci-fit.net)](https://sci-fit.net/detraining/)]
- Beginners can maintain endurance performance for at least 2 weeks without training.
- [[VO2 max]] declines by 6 to 20% in highly trained athletes at around 4 weeks of detraining. Recent VO2max gains can be reversed after 4 weeks.
- To maintain endurance during detraining, you can lower training **volume** by 60 to 90%, training **frequency** by no more than 20-30% in athletes but beginners can reduce it by 50 to 70%. Training **intensity** should be the same.
1. how could MV not increase (too much) despite higher distances required at the same intensity ([[road cycling]])?
	1. because MV is probably based on time (TSS) → you are able to go farther distances with the same intensity (same with [[resistance training]] and volume · weight)
