	1. The London 2012 Olympic Games’ Men’s 10 000 m ﬁnal was won in a time of 27.51 min (27 : 30.42). If an intervention with an effect size of d=1.06 was used in this race (the SD of the 26 ﬁnishing times was±0.62 min) it would equate to an improvement in performance of 0.66 min (∼40 s). If any of the runners ﬁnishing 2nd—17th had ran 40 s faster they would have won the gold medal. In the Women’s 10 000 m race (winning time=30.35 min; ﬁnishers=21; SD=±0.62 min (coincidently the same as the men)) a 40 s improvement would have resulted in any of the top nine ﬁnishers winning the race. Another way to view the performance improvements achievable by precooling is to say that there was a mean improvement of 6.9± 5.7% (range 1.1–17.1%) which would reduce the winning time of the 2012 Olympic Men’s 10 000 m to 25.61 min. It is worth noting that all of the investigations used trained, rather than elite, athletes and so the performance improvements here are likely to be larger than those observed in elite cohorts but performance gains of ∼7% would be highly desirable in races at all levels.^[[(PDF) The effect of cooling prior to and during Exercise on Exercise performance and capacity in the heat: A meta-analysis (researchgate.net)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255954537_The_effect_of_cooling_prior_to_and_during_Exercise_on_Exercise_performance_and_capacity_in_the_heat_A_meta-analysis)]
