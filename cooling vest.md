1. **Conclusions**. Pre-cooling with an ice-vest and sleeves is **likely to have a positive effect on [[time trial]] performance at temperatures above 24˚C**, with a clear relationship between ambient temperature and the magnitude of effect of pre cooling^[[The threshold ambient temperature for the use of pre-cooling to improve cycling time trial performance](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5df4/3c428668a5eb2f64ed14c1c72be12f2aa208.pdf?_gl=1*wh4wa6*_ga*Mzg4MTczMzI3LjE3MDk3NTQ1Nzg.*_ga_H7P4ZT52H5*MTcxNjQ2MTIwNC41LjEuMTcxNjQ2MTQ1Ni4zOS4wLjA.)]
	1. Wafa is co-author of several studies that look at the effect of cooling the body during exercise. She found that during [[anaerobic exercise]] – like a sprint or a cycling [[time trial]] – it’s better to cool down before the activity. **But for endurance activities, like long-distance cycling, it’s better to cool down during the activity**.^[[Tour de France already has a winner: cyclists wearing ice vests (afr.com)](https://www.afr.com/companies/healthcare-and-fitness/the-tour-de-france-already-has-a-winner-ice-vests-20230716-p5domi)]
2. A significant influence of ambient temperature on MMP values was found in [[male and female]] cyclists (P < .001 for both), with no significant differences between sexes (P = .512). **Cyclists attained the highest MMP values at temperate conditions (10-30°C in males and 5-25°C in females)**, whereas an impairment in performance was found at colder and hotter temperatures, particularly for the more extreme conditions (performance impairment at <5°C and >35°C of -18% to -9% and -16% to -9%, respectively)^[[Ambient Temperature and Field-Based Cycling Performance: Insights From Male and Female Professional Cyclists](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35338106/)]
   
   **Conclusions**: Ambient temperature influences field-based cycling performance, following a reverse U-shaped relationship, with the highest MMP values attained in the range of ∼10°C to 25°C and with no major differences between sexes.

	1. The London 2012 Olympic Games’ [[Men]]’s 10 000 m ﬁnal was won in a [[time]] of 27.51 min (27 : 30.42). If an intervention with an effect size of d=1.06 was used in this race (the SD of the 26 ﬁnishing times was±0.62 min) it would equate to an improvement in performance of 0.66 min (∼40 s). If any of the runners ﬁnishing 2nd—17th had ran 40 s faster they would have won the gold medal. In the [[Women]]’s 10 000 m race (winning [[time]]=30.35 min; ﬁnishers=21; SD=±0.62 min (coincidently the same as the [[men]])) a 40 s improvement would have resulted in any of the top nine ﬁnishers winning the race. Another way to view the performance improvements achievable by precooling is to say that there was a mean improvement of 6.9± 5.7% (range 1.1–17.1%) which would reduce the winning [[time]] of the 2012 Olympic [[Men]]’s 10 000 m to 25.61 min. It is worth noting that all of the investigations used trained, rather than elite, athletes and so the performance improvements here are likely to be larger than those observed in elite cohorts but performance gains of ∼7% would be highly desirable in races at all levels.^[[(PDF) The effect of cooling prior to and during Exercise on Exercise performance and capacity in the heat: A meta-analysis (researchgate.net)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255954537_The_effect_of_cooling_prior_to_and_during_Exercise_on_Exercise_performance_and_capacity_in_the_heat_A_meta-analysis)]
