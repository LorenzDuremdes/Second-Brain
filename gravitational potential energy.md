1. gravitational potential [[energy]]; the [potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy) a [massive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass) object has in relation to another massive object due to [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity)
2. Gravitational potential energy increases when two objects are brought further apart.
3. **Image**: depicting [Earth's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) [gravitational field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field). Objects accelerate towards the Earth, thus losing their gravitational energy and transforming it into [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy).
