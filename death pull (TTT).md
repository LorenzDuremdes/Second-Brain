1. death pull (TTT); the riders take as hard a pull at the front as possible in order to resist the pace at the cost of exhausting themselves with no hope of being able to latch onto the back of the formation for drafting. They then drop back and leave the remainder of the team to finish the [[time trial]]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_time_trial]
2. at what intensity should you perhaps do a death pull (TTT)?
	1. whatever achieves the highest **combined** W/CdA e.g. if you are aerodynamically superior to the ones drafting, perhaps do a death pull at upper Z4 and have them sprint at the end
		1. combined W/CdA = e.g. the one in the back has to only expend ~64.1% of your power
