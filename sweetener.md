1. does a calorie-free sweetener work just as effectively against [[stress]]?
	1. What is it about comfort [[food]], exactly, that dampens the stress response? Is it the body’s metabolic response to [[sugar]], [[fat]], and/or calories, or is it the [[food]]’s reward value itself? Yvonne Ulrich-Lai, a neuroscience researcher at the University of Cincinnati, set out to answer this question. She and her team offered rats intermittent access to small volumes of sugar water, water sweetened with the calorie-free sweetener saccharin, or plain water, and then measured the activation of their HPA axis following restraint stress. She hypothesized that sugar’s stress-busting effect is due to its metabolic impact on the body, not its rewarding effects in the brain, and therefore that saccharin would be ineffective. “The result,” explains Ulrich-Lai, “was completely opposite my hypothesis. The saccharin worked just as well as sugar.” Subsequent experiments confirmed that the sweet taste itself was responsible.

2. if food contains an artificial sweetener, it is, by definition, [[ultra-processed food|UPF]]^[Ultra-Processed People The Science Behind the Food That Isnt Food (Chris van Tulleken), p. 178]
