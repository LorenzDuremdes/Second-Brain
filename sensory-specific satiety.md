1. sensory-specific [[satiety]]; a phenomenon that refers to the declining satisfaction generated by the consumption of a certain type of [[food]], and the consequent renewal in [[appetite]] resulting from the exposure to a new flavour or food.
   
   Studies have shown that eating a limited variety of foods can result in monotony effects, which some have termed "long-term sensory-specific satiety". By continuing to eat similar meals, a dieter can reduce their overall food intake and use sensory specific satiety as a tool for [[weight loss]]. In contrast, eating a large variety of foods is thought to be a driver of overconsumption with potential links to [[obesity]] because of the stimulation of appetite from diverse foods. Foods which are high in energy density do not produce a greater level of sensory specific satiety than foods which are low in energy density.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory-specific_satiety]
