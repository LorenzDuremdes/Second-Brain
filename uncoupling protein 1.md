2. UCP-1 → [[sleep]]
	1. UCP-1 knockout mice have weakened homeostatic rebound following [[sleep deprivation]]. They also show a blunted [[sleep]] induction effect of warmer temperatures observed in control mice (Szentirmai and Kapas, 2014). Similarly, the [[beta-3 adrenergic receptor|β3-adrenergic receptor]] agonists, which activate [[brown adipose tissue|BAT]] [[thermogenesis]], usually induce [[sleep]] in control mice but this response is ablated in mice with chemical deafferentation of the BAT (Szentirmai and Kapás, 2017). These data suggest that UCP-1 mediated BAT [[thermogenesis]] is helpful in both recovery [[sleep]] (sleep following [[sleep deprivation]]) and [[NREM sleep]] induction. UCP-1 may also have a role facilitating [[NREM sleep]] during systemic inflammation (Szentirmai and Kapas, 2018). The heat generated by these mechanisms could activate the sensory receptors in the skin and so trigger [[NREM sleep]] (Harding et al., 2018).^[[The Temperature Dependence of Sleep - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/)]
