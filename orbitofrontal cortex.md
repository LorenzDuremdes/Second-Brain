## sexuality
1. orbitofrontal [[cortex]] · reduced activity → sexuality
	1. [[men]] with impairments of this region often demonstrate reckless, risky, hypersexual behaviours^[Spinella, M., ‘Clinical case report: hypersexuality and dysexecutive syndrome after a thalamic infarct’, International Journal of [[Neuroscience]], 2004, 114(12), pp. 1581–90]

		while those with abnormally high activity in the orbitofrontal [[cortex]] (for whatever reason) often report sexual dysfunction and reduced libido^[Stoléru, S., et al., ‘[[Brain]] processing of visual sexual stimuli in [[men]] with hypoactive sexual desire disorder’, [[Psychiatry]] Research: Neuroimaging, 2003, 124(2), pp. 67–86]^[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where [[Happiness]] Comes from, and Why, p. 128]
		1. why "[[men]]" (and (less) [[women]])?
2. orbitofrontal [[cortex]]; important region for sexual fantasising^[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where [[Happiness]] Comes from, and Why, p. 125]
3. regular sexual fantasies → orbitofrontal [[cortex]]^[Ortega, V., I. Zubeidat and J. C. Sierra, ‘Further examination of [[measurement]] properties of Spanish version of the Sexual Desire Inventory with undergraduates and adolescent students’, Psychological Reports, 2006, 99(1), pp. 147–65]^[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where [[Happiness]] Comes from, and Why, p. 125]
	1. there’s evidence to suggest that regular fantasising of this sort improves focus, attention to detail and [[memory]]
4. orbitofrontal [[cortex]]; most important area for control of our sexual urges^[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where [[Happiness]] Comes from, and Why, p. 127]
