		while those with abnormally high activity in the orbitofrontal [[cortex]] (for whatever reason) often report sexual dysfunction and reduced libido^[Stoléru, S., et al., ‘[[Brain]] processing of visual sexual stimuli in [[men]] with hypoactive sexual desire disorder’, [[Psychiatry]] Research: Neuroimaging, 2003, 124(2), pp. 67–86]^[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where [[Happiness]] Comes from, and Why, p. 128]
