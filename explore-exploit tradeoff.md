1. Upper Confidence Bound [[algorithm]] · explore/exploit tradeoff · [[prioritization]] · temporal continuum · diminishing returns = the potential gains naturally lower when exploiting something (or in some cases actually rise e.g. competence)
2. explore/exploit tradeoff → [[level of measurement]]
	1. probably [[ordinal scale]]
3. the beginning values of the Gittins index tend to (usually) mostly gravitate toward explore (rather than exploit)
	1. e.g. younger people have less data → gravitate more toward the beginning values
