1. how can one "calculate" transaction cost efficiency? (relationships)
	1. [[construal level theory]] (the higher, the less efficient, usually)
		1. higher construal level → higher stimulus-to-fatigue ratio
	2. [[learning rate|steps per iteration]]
		1. i.e. the fewer steps required per iteration (while being at or above minimum required accuracy), the more efficient, and the lower the transaction costs between people
2. [[noise (spectral phenomenon)|communication noise]] reduces transaction efficiency
	1. learning rate → increases the steps per iteration
	2. [[stochastic resonance]] → can increase transaction efficiency
3. [[knowledge quality]] → transactionalism
	1. a higher [[knowledge]] quality increases transacton efficiency
		1. e.g. high time utilized (contact)*low time spent learning ([[trust]])
