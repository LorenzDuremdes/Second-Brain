1. *[[spaghetti]] all'assassina*; its preparation is markedly different from other spaghetti dishes; instead of being boiled in salted [[water]] and finished in sauce, the pasta is cooked directly in the pan (traditionally [[cast-iron cookware|cast iron]]). A [[broth]] typically made of [[tomato sauce]] diluted with water is gradually added to the pan as the pasta absorbs it, similar to a [[risotto]]. As the spaghetti absorbs the sauce, it cooks directly on the pan surface, developing significant [[Maillard reaction|browning]] and a distinctive, crispy texture unique among pasta dishes.
