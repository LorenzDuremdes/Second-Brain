1. recursion ([[computer science]]); a method of solving a [[computational problem]] where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)#cite_note-1]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)#cite_note-2]
	1. e.g. bluffing (poker) → you have to estimate what the other thinks you have (+1 level above the other)^[Algorithms to Live By The Computer Science of Human Decisions by Brian Christian, Tom Griffiths, p. 187]
	2. can result in "[[halting problem]]"
3. strategic dominance → recursion ([[computer science]])
	1. the former 'solves' the latter e.g. not having to consider the moves of the other (anymore)^[Algorithms to Live By The Computer Science of Human Decisions by Brian Christian, Tom Griffiths, p. 190]
	2. e.g. by designing a game where being truthful is the dominant strategy (you no longer have to compute others (as much))
