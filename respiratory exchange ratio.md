1. how does [[protein]] ingestion before or during exercise decrease RER?
	1. **ChatGPT**
	   When [[protein catabolism|protein is ingested, amino acids can be used for energy]]. The oxidation of amino acids differs from [[carbohydrate catabolism|carbohydrate]] and [[fatty acid metabolism|fat oxidation]] because it involves the removal of the amino group (deamination or transamination), which does not contribute to [[carbon dioxide|CO₂]] production in the same way as carbohydrate or fat metabolism.
	   
	   RER is the ratio of CO₂ produced to [[oxygen|O₂]] consumed (V̇CO₂ / V̇O₂). → Since protein oxidation leads to an increased oxygen consumption without a proportional increase in CO₂ production (due to nitrogen metabolism and urea cycle involvement), the RER decreases.
	2. Measures of substrate oxidation during exercise are typically interpreted based on the assumption of negligible protein oxidation, but this assumption could be invalidated in the context of protein ingestion before or during exercise because of increased [[gluconeogenesis]], which could decrease RER irrespective of any change in fat oxidation rate via transfer of the amino group to the [[urea cycle]]^[[A Novel Method to Predict Carbohydrate and Energy Expenditure During Endurance Exercise Using Measures of Training Load (2024)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-024-02131-z)]
