1. [[sleep]] low-train low; high-intensity training (HIT) in the evening to deplete [[glycogen]] stores, followed by low CHO availability overnight (i.e., sleeping low), and low-intensity training (LIT) the next morning under conditions of low muscle [[glycogen]]/CHO availability^[[Three weeks of a home-based “sleep low-train low” intervention improves functional threshold power in trained cyclists: A feasibility study - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8639084/)]
	1. Participant’s daily [[carbohydrate]] (CHO) intake (6 g·kg-1·d-1) was matched but timed differently to manipulate CHO availability around exercise: no CHO consumption post- HIT until post-LIT sessions [[[Sleep]] Low (SL), n = 28] or CHO consumption evenly distributed throughout the day [Control (CON), n = 27]
