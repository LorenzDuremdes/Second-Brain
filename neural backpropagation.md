1. neural backpropagation; the phenomenon in which after the action potential of a neuron creates a voltage spike down the axon (normal propagation) another impulse is generated from the soma and propagates toward to the apical portions of the dendritic arbor or dendrites, from which much of the original input current originate
2. **This diagram displays how the dendritic voltage spike comes after the depolarization of the axon and soma.**^[By Greg Stuart a, Nelson Spruston b, Bert Sakmann c, Michael HÃ¤usser b - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166223696100758, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=74714345]
