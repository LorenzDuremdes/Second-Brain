# formula
1. happiness formula:^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 103]
	1. H=S+C+V
		1. H=happiness
		2. S=biological set point
		3. C=life conditions (e.g. age, [[noise (unwanted acoustic phenomenon)|noise]], commuting, relationships, control)
		4. V=voluntary activities

## life conditions
### [[noise (unwanted acoustic phenomenon)]]
1. research shows that people who must adapt to new and chronic sources of noise (such as when a new highway is built) **never fully adapt**, and even studies that find some adaptation still find evidence of impairment on cognitive tasks^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 104]

### commute
1. moving farther away from their jobs in search of a larger house → happiness
	1. people quickly adapt to having more space, but they **don't fully adapt** to the longer commute^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 104]
		1. the net increase in happiness is short-lived
2. is a longer commute always having a negative impact on "happiness"? + why
	1. no e.g. driving under ideal conditions is often enjoyable and **relaxing**^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom]
		1. e.g. you [[road cycling|cycling]] to ASSortiMens

## related
1. [[biopsychosocial model]]
	1. S=biological
	2. C=sociological
	3. V=psychological

# [[behavioral neuroscience|biopsychology]]
1. reinforcement works best when it comes seconds after the behavior, not minutes or hours (primitive [[brain]] regions)
	1. the elephant works the same way: It feels pleasure whenever it takes a step in the right direction. The elephant learns whenever pleasure (or pain) follows immediately after behavior, but it has trouble connecting success on Friday with actions it took on Monday^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 95]
2. people’s average level of [[happiness]] is highly heritable^[The [[happiness]] Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 98]
	1. those with a lower average level of [[happiness]] are more willing to make progress?
	2. can be changed via e.g. [[medication]]? → "The degree of [[heritability]] places no constraint on the degree of modifiability."

# [[women]]
1. how are [[women]] on average not any happier than [[men]] when experiencing more e.g. [[depression]]?
	1. [[women]] also experience more intense joy^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 100]

# age
1. older people tend to be happier than younger^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 100]
