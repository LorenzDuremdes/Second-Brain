# formula
1. happiness formula:^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 103]
	1. H=S+C+V
		1. H=happiness
		2. S=biological set point
		3. C=life conditions (e.g. age, [[noise (unwanted acoustic phenomenon)|noise]], commuting, relationships, control)
		4. V=voluntary activities

## voluntary activities
1. what state produces the most happiness?^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 107]
	1. flow
		1. in the flow experience, elephant and rider are in perfect harmony

## life conditions
1. what does the book "The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 229" mean with "happiness comes from _between_"?
	1. it comes from between internal and external factors (probably the dynamic interplay e.g. one's [[career]])

### [[noise (unwanted acoustic phenomenon)]]
1. research shows that people who must adapt to new and chronic sources of noise (such as when a new highway is built) **never fully adapt**, and even studies that find some adaptation still find evidence of impairment on cognitive tasks^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 104]

### commute
1. moving farther away from their jobs in search of a larger house → happiness
	1. people quickly adapt to having more space, but they **don't fully adapt** to the longer commute^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 104]
		1. the net increase in happiness is short-lived
2. is a longer commute always having a negative impact on "happiness"? + why
	1. no e.g. driving under ideal conditions is often enjoyable and **relaxing**^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom]
		1. e.g. you [[road cycling|cycling]] to ASSortiMens

## [[interpersonal relationship]]
1. what "external condition" has, usually, the biggest impact on "happiness"?^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 106]
	1. [[interpersonal relationship]]
2. most people don't adapt to interpersonal conflict^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 106]

## related
1. [[biopsychosocial model]]
	1. S=biological
	2. C=sociological
	3. V=psychological

# things influencing happiness
1. improve the following:

	"X makes us happy."
	
	>"X can make it easier to be happy."^[[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where Happiness Comes from, and Why, p. 59]]
	1. removes splitting ([[psychology]]) + complex
1. greater intelligence is more likely to make you happier^[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where Happiness Comes from, and Why, p. 65]
2. competence → happiness^[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where Happiness Comes from, and Why, p. 72]
	1. when we feel we're competent, we're more likely to be happy

## material

# [[psychology]]
## [[habituation]]
1. how can there be less to none [[habituation]] to your home in relationship to happiness?^[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where Happiness Comes from, and Why, p. 40]
	1. because it's biologically significant (vital functions e.g. nourishment, sleeping, warmth, plumbing)

# [[neuroscience]]
## [[neurophysiology]]
1. primitive brains → prestige vs. happiness
	1. the 'elephant' cares about prestige, not happiness^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 113]
	2. **related**
		1. [[gene-centered view of evolution]]

## [[behavioral neuroscience|biopsychology]]
1. reinforcement works best when it comes seconds after the behavior, not minutes or hours (primitive [[brain]] regions)
	1. the elephant works the same way: It feels [[pleasure]] whenever it takes a step in the right direction. The elephant learns whenever [[pleasure]] (or pain) follows immediately after behavior, but it has trouble connecting success on Friday with actions it took on Monday^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 95]
2. people’s average level of [[happiness]] is highly heritable^[The [[happiness]] Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 98]
	1. those with a lower average level of [[happiness]] are more willing to make progress?
	2. can be changed via e.g. [[medication]]? → "The degree of [[heritability]] places no constraint on the degree of modifiability."

### adaptation
1. what is a big component to avoid adaptation (happiness)?
	1. variety^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 108]
		1. same as when building fitness
