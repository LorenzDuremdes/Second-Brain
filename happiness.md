# formula
1. happiness formula:^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 103]
	1. H=S+C+V
		1. H=happiness
		2. S=biological set point
		3. C=life conditions (e.g. age, [[noise (unwanted acoustic phenomenon)|noise]], commuting, relationships, control)
		4. V=voluntary activities

## voluntary activities
1. what state produces the most happiness?^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 107]
	1. flow
		1. in the flow experience, elephant and rider are in perfect harmony

## life conditions
1. what does the book "The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 229" mean with "happiness comes from _between_"?
	1. it comes from between internal and external factors (probably the dynamic interplay e.g. one's [[career]])

### [[noise (unwanted acoustic phenomenon)]]
1. research shows that people who must adapt to new and chronic sources of noise (such as when a new highway is built) **never fully adapt**, and even studies that find some adaptation still find evidence of impairment on cognitive tasks^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 104]

### commute
1. moving farther away from their jobs in search of a larger house → happiness
	1. people quickly adapt to having more space, but they **don't fully adapt** to the longer commute^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 104]
		1. the net increase in happiness is short-lived
2. is a longer commute always having a negative impact on "happiness"? + why
	1. no e.g. driving under ideal conditions is often enjoyable and **relaxing**^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom]
		1. e.g. you [[road cycling|cycling]] to ASSortiMens

## [[interpersonal relationship]]
1. what "external condition" has, usually, the biggest impact on "happiness"?^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 106]
	1. [[interpersonal relationship]]
2. most people don't adapt to interpersonal conflict^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 106]

## related
1. [[biopsychosocial model]]
	1. S=biological
	2. C=sociological
	3. V=psychological

# things influencing happiness
1. improve the following:

	"X makes us happy."
	
	>"X can make it easier to be happy."^[[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where Happiness Comes from, and Why, p. 59]]
	1. removes splitting ([[psychology]]) + complex
1. greater [[intelligence]] is more likely to make you happier^[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where Happiness Comes from, and Why, p. 65]
	1. why? ◇e.g. more freedom of action
2. competence → happiness^[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where Happiness Comes from, and Why, p. 72]
	1. when we feel we're competent, we're more likely to be happy

## material
1. a tendency to focus on financial matters reduces the likelihood that you'll be happy, regardless of income (at least among American [[women]])^[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where Happiness Comes from, and Why, p. 80]

# [[psychology]]
1. how can the pursuit of happiness be [[self]]-defeating?^[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where Happiness Comes from, and Why, p. 155]
	1. these things that everyone assumes will make us happy, namely [[sex]], love and romance, can make us seriously unhappy if our brains are too focused on them, at the expense of other things that likely would make us happy e.g. focusing on other things e.g. laughing
## [[habituation]]
1. how can there be less to none [[habituation]] to your home in relationship to happiness?^[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where Happiness Comes from, and Why, p. 40]
	1. because it's biologically significant (vital functions e.g. nourishment, sleeping, warmth, plumbing)

# [[neuroscience]]
## [[neurophysiology]]
1. primitive brains → prestige vs. happiness
	1. the 'elephant' cares about prestige, not happiness^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 113]
	2. **related**
		1. [[gene-centered view of evolution]]

## [[behavioral neuroscience|biopsychology]]
1. reinforcement works best when it comes seconds after the behavior, not minutes or hours (primitive [[brain]] regions)
	1. the elephant works the same way: It feels [[pleasure]] whenever it takes a step in the right direction. The elephant learns whenever [[pleasure]] (or pain) follows immediately after behavior, but it has trouble connecting success on Friday with actions it took on Monday^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 95]
2. people’s average level of [[happiness]] is highly heritable^[The [[happiness]] Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 98]
	1. those with a lower average level of [[happiness]] are more willing to make progress?
	2. can be changed via e.g. [[medication]]? → "The degree of [[heritability]] places no constraint on the degree of modifiability."

### adaptation
1. what is a big component to avoid adaptation (happiness)?
	1. variety^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 108]
		1. same as when building fitness
		2. variety can also be in terms of intensity? (progressive overload)

# [[sociology]]
## [[microsociology]]
1. how could "the pursuit of happiness be **lonely**"?^[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51631109_The_Pursuit_of_Happiness_Can_Be_Lonely]^[The Happy [[Brain]]: The Science of Where Happiness Comes from, and Why, p. 86]
	1. striving for happiness usually requires striving for personal gains (in western contexts)
	2. this might damage people's connections with others

# [[women]]
1. how are [[women]] on average not any happier than [[men]] when experiencing more e.g. [[depression]]?

		1. mostly reducing [[shame]] e.g. not having to adjust their posture/wardrobe as frequently/intensively

# age
1. older people tend to be happier than younger^[The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom, p. 100]
