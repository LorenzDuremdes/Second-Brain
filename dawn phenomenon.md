1. dawn phenomenon; sometimes called the dawn effect, is an observed increase in [[blood sugar level|blood sugar (glucose) levels]] that takes place in the early-morning, often between 2 a.m. and 8 a.m
   
   First described by Schmidt in 1981 as an increase of blood [[glucose]] or [[insulin]] demand occurring at dawn, this naturally occurring phenomenon is frequently seen among the general population and is clinically relevant for patients with [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] as it can affect their medical management. In contrast to Chronic Somogyi rebound, the dawn phenomenon is not associated with nocturnal [[hypoglycemia]].
   
   Although not yet completely understood, the dawn phenomenon is thought to be caused by an exaggeration of the normal physiologic [[hormone|hormonal]] processes that occur overnight. Overnight, the human body sees increased levels of several hormones, most notably [[growth hormone]] and [[catecholamine|catecholamines]], that lead to increased rates of [[gluconeogenesis|glucose production]] and release from the [[liver]]. These hormones also inhibit the effects of insulin, leading to an overall increase in circulating blood glucose. This effect is amplified in patients with islet Î²-cell dysfunction such as diabetics. Notably throughout this process [[glucagon]] levels remain unchanged and the increased levels of [[cortisol]] observed overnight do not appear to be involved.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_phenomenon]
