# hypotheses
1. how could MK-677 improve [[sleep]]?
   ◇
	1. mimics higher HGH during night (and 'tricking' the brain into thinking it's sleeping time e.g. same with melatonin)
	2. faster recovery, so less (NREM) [[sleep]] needed for the body (and being able to spend more on REM hence some users saying it affects their dreams?)
