1. how should the stronger guy do pulls in a TTT?
	1. One key is that if you are stronger than your colleagues, you don’t pull harder, just longer. The squads that practise know how to manage this - the ones that don’t splinter when the strong guys get to the front and the guy trying to get on the back is croaking “wait” as they disappear up the road. If you’re truly on the limit, shouting to be heard up the line is incredibly hard!^[https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/optimal-pacing-rotation-for-4-man-ttt/15565/5?u=lorenz_duremdes]
	2. Accelerations require harder efforts, and therefore it is desirable to have a smooth, steady pace. Different riders have different power outputs, [[lactate threshold|lactate thresholds]] and aerodynamics. In order to equalize the efforts in order to not burn some riders off too early, the weaker riders take shorter pulls and stronger riders take longer pulls, all at the same speed to minimize the change in pace.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_time_trial#Tactics_and_formation]
	3. the weaker guy should pull uphill and the stronger guy downhill^[https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/optimal-pacing-rotation-for-4-man-ttt/15565/6?u=lorenz_duremdes]
	4. the bigger/heavier guy should pull downhill
