	1. I kept a video diary during this period and one entry tells of a three-hour ride on a dark, cold night, when my legs were sore. It should have been deeply unpleasant, except it wasn't. By the end of the ride, when I should have been wasted, I was as fresh as a daisy. This was to be become a feature. By week eight, the changes were obvious. I was climbing big hills four hours into a ride as if they were not there.
3. The problem is not unique to the sprints. With 13 women's world records in the Olympic track and field events still standing from the 1980s – all before the introduction of mandatory random [[drug]] testing in 1989 – some feel that a clean athlete will never be able to surpass those marks.^[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/aug/16/world-athletics-championships-records]

### East German protocol (improved / modernized)
1. [[chlorodehydromethyltestosterone]] (Oral Turinabol) and other [[long-acting substance|long-acting substances]] with East German protocol (**they designed this for a multi-year approach e.g. breaking an athlete breaking _their own_ world records steadily year after year**)
2. use [[GW501516]] (Cardarine) and other [[fast-acting substance|fast-acting substances]] only last [[microcycle]] and only on hard days (usually 3–4 hard days)
	1. they usually don't aid in recovery but are aimed at allowing high performances/intensities (i.e. not sustainable long-term)
3. between mesocycles = MV (usually doesn't require a lot e.g. 50% volume with 90% intensity)
	1. with [[block (sports periodization)]] to still make progress in specific areas
