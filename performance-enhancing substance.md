	1. I kept a video diary during this period and one entry tells of a three-hour ride on a dark, cold night, when my legs were sore. It should have been deeply unpleasant, except it wasn't. By the end of the ride, when I should have been wasted, I was as fresh as a daisy. This was to be become a feature. By week eight, the changes were obvious. I was climbing big hills four hours into a ride as if they were not there.

With 13 women's world records in the Olympic track and field events still standing from the 1980s – all before the introduction of mandatory random [[drug]] testing in 1989 – some feel that a clean athlete will never be able to surpass those marks.^[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/aug/16/world-athletics-championships-records]

«I can tell you personally what I found so interesting in taking all this stuff. It wasn’t like all of a sudden I was Superman. That, I was really disappointed by. I had this idea, “I’m going to take EPO and testosterone and HGH and all this stuff. And all of the sudden, I’m just going to go out there and wow, I’m going to beat all my Strava times.” That did not happen. It did not happen.

But what did happen, which was the amazingness of it — which again, calls into the philosophical debate — was, I was recovering. The recovery was amazing. And so I would go out and train. All the same pain was there, all the same dying and all those feelings that cyclists feel when they are pushing themselves to the limit at whatever ability they are. All of that was there.

The only difference is that I could suffer and kill myself and literally go to the place that I feel like I’m going to die, but the next day, I was better able to do that. My body had not torn itself down as radically as it had before. The biggest thing was, which I don’t get into in the film, is at the end of that first Haute Route [in 2014], where I had trained like hell in Boulder…. it’s this seven-day race. The hardest day was 17,000 feet of climbing. The shortest day was 11,000 feet of climbing. It was just brutal. And at the end of that first race, I finished 14th. But the last two, three days of that, I couldn’t even walk.Not only did I not touch my bike for three weeks, I went into rehab. I had Achilles tendonitis. I had hip dysplasia. I was ripped to shreds. I had just destroyed myself.

The second year [2015], I had a technical problem. My Di2 broke and I lost an hour. I had a crash that I don’t show on camera, because we didn’t capture it on camera. I had a flat tire, which I don’t show on camera, because we didn’t capture it, and I lost five minutes because the neutral support van got to me five minutes later. So I’d lost all this time and I probably would have gotten 10th place, but the biggest difference is that I finished day seven of that race with the leaders. There was two guys ahead. And then I came in with the group of 10 right behind. So I was having my very best day in the entire race on the final day of the race. And had that race gone on another week, I would have been fine. I was like, “Bring on day eight. Bring on day nine. Bring on day 10.” I was literally getting better.

I had a physiotherapist. She was working on me every night. About day four, she goes, “You know, this is kind of extraordinary. Your muscles are not deteriorating. You’re not breaking down. You’re recovering.” And that to me, was the most amazing thing — which I attribute to the testosterone and the HGH — that I was able to recover. That recovery, it had nothing to do with how much I would suffer every day. It was just that I was able to recover. That recovery is pretty substantial.»

«As to the long-term effects… first of all, I experienced no negative side effects. And I’m not a doctor, but pretty much everything I was taking, with the exception of erythropoietin, I was able to get a prescription for through the auspices of anti-aging. And then I was being monitored, and my blood levels checked, and all that stuff, too, to try to keep it at safe levels.

So I didn’t experience any negative side effects, and quite the contrary. I experienced better recovery, better libido, I found myself sleeping better. Better metabolism. My body just seemed to be metabolizing fat better, with the increase in hormones. My Achilles tendonitis went away, my hip dysplasia went away. I was having these knee problems, that went away. So you’re kind of going, “Wait. All these ailments suddenly are going away, and I’m sleeping better, and I’m recovering better, and my libido’s amazing, and I’m burning fat.” It was kind of like, “Huh. I don’t know what the negatives are.” Other than if you’re a competitive cyclist, or athlete, and you’re under WADA Code, and the rules are that you don’t take this. And that’s the rules, so I believe that you should be clean, 100%, if you’re competing.

But if you’re an amateur, and you’re out there and just enjoying the sport, and you’re just out there and just love the sport, and you’re training for your own purposes, and you’re in your forties, or in your fifties, or in your sixties, my own personal experience would say that these really helped in my recovery, and just helped my overall wellbeing.»

«You wound up finishing worse than the previous year at the Haute Route -- an amateur race considered to be tougher than the Tour de France. What was the takeaway?

I had some technical issues that weren't shown [in the film]. These drugs don't make you any better of an athlete. What they allow you to do is recover. That was the biggest difference. The first year I walked out of that race and was in physical therapy for three weeks. I could barely walk. I had Achilles tendinitis, I had hip dysplasia. I trained just as hard the second year, but with the testosterone and the HGH and EPO and these vitamins injections I was taking, I was recovering.»

«How is your body? What happened to your body taking all those PEDs?

All good things!

Did you, like, age backwards?

Yeah. From what I’ve seen with all the hormone therapy and whatever you want to consider doping, I’ve only seen positive effects. I mean, the same thing that’s considered as doping is the same thing being sold as anti-aging. On one hand, we’re being told, “This is bad for you,” and on the other hand, we’re being told that this is the fountain of youth. It’s great to take HGH, I guess, if you want to help your body recover in age, but if you’re Peyton Manning and you actually need it to recover to do your job as a professional athlete, which you’re being paid tens of millions of dollars to do, that’s wrong.

So what did you take?

HGH, testosterone, erythropoietin [EPO], thyroid hormones, DHEA [a steroid], HCG [a weight-loss hormone], all sorts of different vitamin injections.

Have you kept taking them?

I still take testosterone, which I personally have found is just great. It’s very subtle, but it helps how I feel. Like, I’m alert, clear. I’m now in my early 40s and basically, from the time you’re about 30, your testosterone just starts falling off a cliff, and apparently when you hit 40 it just goes off a cliff. So if I can have the testosterone level of a 21-year-old, why not? [Laughs.] I don’t see the harm in it!»

«The whole impetus for taking PEDs was to see if you’d improve your placement in that amateur bike race from the year before when you rode clean. You didn’t. Why’s that?

I had a mechanical [problem], which cost me an hour. Had I not encountered all those problems, I would’ve finished 12th or 13th of the 660 people who started.

You did so well NOT on drugs!

The thing is, after I got out of that race the first year, I couldn’t walk. I finished 14th out of 440 and I spent the next month recovering, like, on crutches. I was destroyed. In the second year, I finished the race and I was like, “Bring on the next week!” It was a pretty radical difference in my recovery, and I had trained very, very similarly the first and second year. The testosterone and HGH, and all that stuff seemed to help me recover.»^[https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/sp8ira/icarus_2017_bryan_fogel_starts_doping_with_the/]

### East German protocol (improved / modernized)
1. [[chlorodehydromethyltestosterone]] (Oral Turinabol) and other [[long-acting substance|long-acting substances]] with East German protocol (**they designed this for a multi-year approach e.g. breaking an athlete breaking _their own_ world records steadily year after year**)
2. use [[GW501516]] (Cardarine) and other [[fast-acting substance|fast-acting substances]] only last [[microcycle]] and only on hard days (usually 3–4 hard days)
	1. they usually don't aid in recovery but are aimed at allowing high performances/intensities (i.e. not sustainable long-term)
3. between mesocycles = MV (usually doesn't require a lot e.g. 50% volume with 90% intensity)
	1. with [[block (sports periodization)]] to still make progress in specific areas
