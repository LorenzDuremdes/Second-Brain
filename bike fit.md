1. bike fit → mileage^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 211]
	1. try to keep mileage/intensity low after changing things (e.g. saddle height) to reduce injury
		1. your body has adapted to the old configuration (even if it was less optimal)
2. most critical bone contributing to [[road cycling]]
	1. The **hip** is the cornerstone of the pedal stroke. It is related to almost every element of the pedal stroke, including the path of the legs and posture. Movements such as flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, medial and lateral rotation, transverse abduction (extension), and transverse adduction (flexion) all rely on the hip. If you don’t have the hip positioned correctly, you don’t stand a chance of repeating the best pedal stroke millions of times.^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 189]
3. why do other [[aerobic exercise|endurance sports]] not requiring as much "fitting" as [[road cycling]] (bike fitting)?
	1. Cycling is different from endurance sports such as running and swimming, which are also repetitive but allow more body movement. Cycling keeps the body fixed in one plane of motion, and both cyclists and bike fitters must adhere to this constraint.^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 189]

# saddle

^260392

1. what does the Retül software see during incorrect saddle height?^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 200]
	1. too high saddle = plantar flexion
		too low saddle = dorsiflexion
2. Serotta's first saddle iteration
	1. saddle selection (contact points)^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 205]
3. ankling → saddle height
	1. ankling (dorsiflexion/plantar flexion) needs to be accounted for when determining optimal saddle height^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 206]
4. saddle fore/aft → patella
	1. can prevent injury to the kneecap^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 210]
	2. one of BikeFit's configurations

# [[bicycle pedal]]
## clipless pedals
1. how much float does Retül advocate?
	1. 4–6 degrees^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 200]
2. We teach fitters that [[knee]] tracking problems often originate in the hip, not the [[foot]].^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 200]
	1. For inversion or eversion, we advocate using varus heel wedges to correct for overpronated feet only.

# [[knee]]
1. optimal [[knee]] angle (BikeFit)
	1. 30–37 degrees^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 210]
2. how many cyclists experienced [[knee pain|knee problems]] at least once?
	1. 23^[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20847225/]–33%^[https://www.ajol.info/index.php/sasma/article/view/114842]
