	2. that they won’t sleep with us  
	3. that the reason why has nothing to do with any deficiency on our part
2. flirting ↮ compliment
	1. the other might believe in a flirt more than a direct compliment^[https://www.theschooloflife.com/thebookoflife/why-flirting-matters/]

### [[women]]
1. how could saying "Wow! You are beautiful!" as a compliment be ineffective to an attractive girl?^[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Zu5ZZAG7I]
	1. she's probably heard it a hundred thousand times today

## [[liking (persuasion)]]
1. hoe kan rondlopen met een racefiets voordelig werken (meisjes benaderen)?
	1. status
	2. je ziet er uit alsof je niet meisjes benaderd alleen om een afspraak te regelen
	3. ook als symbool voor het gevoel van veiligheid ([[association (psychology)]])

# where
## effective
1. pubs ([[proxemics]])^[http://www.sirc.org/publik/flirt.html]
	1. tables furthest from the bar counter are the most 'private' zones e.g. making flirting less socially acceptable
2. are "learning-places (e.g. universities)" good places for "flirting"? + why^[http://www.sirc.org/publik/flirt.html]
	1. yes, because this is largely because they are full of young single people making their first attempts at mate selection

		also because of e.g. shared lifestyles and topics

# girls' perspective
1. [Cold approach from a girl's perspective](https://old.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/hfue6s/cold_approach_from_a_girls_perspective/fw0afnm/)
	
	Generally: say something observational or something the two of you could have in common just from the first impression: her outfit ("You look like you're ready to party/kick some ass/impress someone"), a pet she's walking ("Cute dog") or the ingredients in her grocery basket ("Hey, making taco's tonight?")

	Any of these openers can spark a conversation in which you can feel out if she might be interested in going on a date with you. **Honestly, even asking for directions or the time can work, as long as you can continue the conversation beyond the initial approach**.
	
	After that you just have to improvise based on her reaction. You can stay on the same topic if she reacted positively - for example if you complimented her outfit, ask her what the occasion is that she got dressed up for...? Questions like these might give you insight in whether or not she's single as well.

	If you are used to being flirty right off the bat, you can do that but try to make her feel comfortable first instead of seeming aggressive/threatening.

2. https://old.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/hfue6s/cold_approach_from_a_girls_perspective/fw2ul41/
	...when you greet me with a neutral opening, you give me an opportunity to show you my [[personality]] and therefore you get to know this tiniest detail about me, so if you then proceed to lead the conversation towards getting my number, I at least know that there's a possibility that you're doing this because you find me an interesting [[human]] being and not just a physically attractive [[sex]] partner (or something along the lines). And **you're showing some of your [[personality]]** as well and while I might not have been into you at first glance, people can often change their mind based on a person's energy
1. I’ve even dated guys who approached me this way in the past, because **it feels like they want to get know me**^[https://old.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/hfue6s/cold_approach_from_a_girls_perspective/fw0as7c/]
2. he just enjoyed talking to me as a **[[human]] being** and not his possible [[sex]] partner^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/n403ro/ladies_what_are_some_things_which_men_dont_know/gwuihxl?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
3. do girls like being approached?^[https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mof1oq/how_does_one_approach_women_when_it_seems_like/gu4dfi4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
	1. yes, unless the guy doesn't go away while showing disinterest
	2. Personally, **I really don't mind being approached anywhere**, it's more about how you go about it. Provided you're nice and back off if I'm not interested, I'll take it as a compliment no matter where it is.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/sn08h/ladies_when_and_where_is_it_ok_to_approach_you/c4fbm4j?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]

# [[men]] + [[women]]

## [[men]] ↮ [[women]]
1. One study found that [[men]] are more likely to use dominance signals through body orientation, such as taking up space or leaning in. Meanwhile, **[[women]]** tend to engage in body presentation, by **accentuating physical features** through posture, twirling their hair, or caressing their lips or neck.^[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00989317#page-1]^[https://bigthink.com/neuropsych/how-to-flirt/]
2. [[women]] need to be particularly careful to avoid sending ambiguous signals in interactions with married [[men]]^[http://www.sirc.org/publik/flirt.html]
	1. why? research has also shown that [[men]] have a tendency to mistake friendly behaviour for sexual flirting

# statistics
## [[sociology]]
1. do many people feel anxious to flirt?^[https://bigthink.com/neuropsych/how-to-flirt/]
	1. probably yes
2. people recognize non-flirting more accurately than flirting^[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/meet-catch-and-keep/201408/how-spot-flirt]
	1. [[women]] were ~83% accurate in seeing non-flirting as non-flirting and [[men]] ~84%
	2. [[women]] are ~18% accurate in recognizing [[men]]'s flirting as flirting
		1. [[men]] did better, but with only a 36% accuracy rate

### effective
1. Both [[men]] and [[women]] are equally good at recognizing certain verbal communications as flirting (Henningsen et al., 2009). Specifically, they interpret sexual interest from compliments; overt references to being single/available to date someone else; and using mild sexual innuendos as signs of interest.^[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/meet-catch-and-keep/201408/how-spot-flirt]

# analogs
