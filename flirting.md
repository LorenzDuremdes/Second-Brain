	Generally: say something observational or something the two of you could have in common just from the first impression: her outfit ("You look like you're ready to party/kick some ass/impress someone"), a pet she's walking ("Cute dog") or the ingredients in her grocery basket ("Hey, making taco's tonight?")

	Any of these openers can spark a conversation in which you can feel out if she might be interested in going on a date with you. **Honestly, even asking for directions or the time can work, as long as you can continue the conversation beyond the initial approach**.
	
	After that you just have to improvise based on her reaction. You can stay on the same topic if she reacted positively - for example if you complimented her outfit, ask her what the occasion is that she got dressed up for...? Questions like these might give you insight in whether or not she's single as well.

	If you are used to being flirty right off the bat, you can do that but try to make her feel comfortable first instead of seeming aggressive/threatening.

	...when you greet me with a neutral opening, you give me an opportunity to show you my personality and therefore you get to know this tiniest detail about me, so if you then proceed to lead the conversation towards getting my number, I at least know that there's a possibility that you're doing this because you find me an interesting human being and not just a physically attractive sex partner (or something along the lines). And **you're showing some of your personality** as well and while I might not have been into you at first glance, people can often change their mind based on a person's energy
