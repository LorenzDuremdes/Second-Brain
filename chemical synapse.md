1. chemical [[synapse]]; biological junctions through which neurons' signals can be sent to each other and to non-neuronal cells such as those in muscles or glands
2. Chemical synapses are not the only type of biological [[synapse]]: electrical and immunological synapses also exist. Without a qualifier, however, "[[synapse]]" commonly refers to chemical [[synapse]].
3. chemical synapse; electrical activity in the presynaptic [[neuron]] is converted (via the activation of voltage-gated calcium channels) into the release of a [[biochemistry|chemical]] called a [[neurotransmitter]] that binds to [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] located in the [[plasma membrane]] of the postsynaptic [[cell]]. The neurotransmitter may initiate an electrical response or a secondary messenger pathway that may either excite or inhibit the postsynaptic [[neuron]]

6. chemical synapses can be classified according to the [[neurotransmitter]] released:
	1. glutamatergic (often excitatory)
	2. GABAergic (often inhibitory)
	3. cholinergic (e.g. vertebrate [[neuromuscular junction]]), and
	4. adrenergic (releasing [[norepinephrine]])
