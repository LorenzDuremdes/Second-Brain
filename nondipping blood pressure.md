1. nondipping [[blood pressure]]; if there is no decrease in nighttime mean systolic BP or a drop of less than 10 mmHg
   
   Although it fluctuates over the 24-hr day and night, the morning BP increases after waking up and declines throughout [[sleep]]. It is typical for BP to decrease by 10% to 20%, while sleeping, known as dipping BP.
   
   Conversely, reverse dipping BP means an increase in mean systolic BP instead of a drop during the night. Reverse dipping is observed in hypertension (HTN), [[diabetes mellitus]] (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and [[obstructive sleep apnea]] (OSA) syndrome.^[[Effects of Nondipping Blood Pressure Changes: A Nephrologist Prospect - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10464654/)]
