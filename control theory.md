*not to be confused with: [[stochastic control]]*

1. control theory; deals with the control of continuously operating [[dynamical system theory|dynamical systems]] in engineered processes and machines
2. the objective is to develop a control model for controlling such systems using a control action in an optimum manner without delay or overshoot and ensuring control [[stability theory|stability]]
	1. delay/overshoot â†’ decreases control?
