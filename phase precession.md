1. phase precession; a neurophysiological process in which the firing of action potentials by individual neurons is timed in relation to the phase of neural oscillations in the surrounding cells
2. In place cells, a type of neuron found in the hippocampal region of the [[brain]], phase precession is believed to play a major role in the neural coding of [[information]].
3. Spatial firing patterns of 8 place cells recorded from the hippocampal CA1 layer of a rat's [[brain]]. Dots indicate positions (place fields) where action potentials were recorded as the rat moved back and forth along a track, with color indicating which neuron emitted that action potential.

4. phase precession → [[social resonance]]
	1. the former increases the latter?
5. phase precession → [[parallel computing|parallel]] vs. sequential
	1. as a complex → parallel
	2. multiple phase precessions → sequential
