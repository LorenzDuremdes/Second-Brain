1. Standing instead of sitting burns three times more kcal per hour, gum chewing increases energy expenditure four times, and stair climbing more than 40 times above resting levels (45)

1. Levine’s group was the first to systematically investigate the effect of overfeeding on the individual ability to adapt NEAT in free-living subjects (53). Using sophisticated methods and measuring NEAT over a representative time span, the authors overfed 16 volunteers (12 males, 4 females; age ranging from 25-36 years) by 1000 [[calorie|kcal]] per day over their weight maintenance requirements (20% of the calories came from [[protein]], 40% from [[fat]], 40% from [[carbohydrate|carbohydrates]]). The [[energy]] surplus was paralleled by a mean [[energy expenditure|TEE]] increment of 554 kcal per day. In this study 14% of this TEE increase was attributable to a rise in REE, approximating by 79 kcal per day. A further 25% of the TEE increment (136 kcal per day) corresponded to an increase in [[specific dynamic action|TEF]], probably due to the relatively high percentage of protein intake. The most prominent effect was, however, attributable to enhanced physical activity [[thermogenesis]], corresponding to around 336 kcal per day. As volitional exercise of the study subjects remained at a constant low level and since the authors did not detect changes in exercise efficiency, they concluded that about 60% of the increase in TEE due to overfeeding was attributable to NEAT (53). Again, however, **the change in NEAT varied remarkably between subjects, ranging from -98 to +692 kcal per day. The maximal individual increase of NEAT constituted 69% of the excessively consumed 1000 kcal per day in this study** (74). Moreover, the change in NEAT was directly predictive of the individual vulnerability or[[obesity| resistance to body fat accumulation]] (53).^[[Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis in Human Energy Homeostasis (2022)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279077/)]
   
   In a carefully controlled overfeeding study, his team showed that the primary reason some people readily burn off excess calories is that they ramp up a form of calorie burning called “non-exercise activity thermogenesis” (NEAT). NEAT is basically a fancy term for fidgeting. When certain people overeat, their brains boost calorie expenditure by making them fidget, change posture frequently, and make other small movements throughout the day. It’s an involuntary process, and Levine’s data show that it can incinerate nearly 700 Calories per day! The “most gifted” of Levine’s subjects gained less than a pound of body fat from eating 1,000 extra Calories per day for eight weeks. Yet the strength of the response was highly variable, and the “least gifted” of Levine’s subjects didn’t increase NEAT at all, shunting all the excess calories into fat tissue and gaining over nine pounds of body fat. For Levine, the study highlighted the importance of light physical activity throughout the day, which inspired him to invent the treadmill desk.^[The Hungry Brain (Stephan J. Guyenet, Ph.D.), p. 185]

1. Weight loss maintainers had physical activity thermogenesis of roughly 12 kcal/kg/d as compared to weight regainers with approximately 8 kcal/kg/d, which was reflectetd by a significant negative correlation of body mass regain and physical activity levels (114).^[[Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis in Human Energy Homeostasis (2022)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279077/)]

1. We used the largest dataset compiled on adult TEE and basal energy expenditure (BEE) (n = 1,754) of people living normal lives to find that energy compensation by a typical human averages 28% due to reduced BEE; this suggests that only 72% of the extra calories we burn from additional activity translates into extra calories burned that day. Moreover, the degree of energy compensation varied considerably between people of different body compositions.^[[Energy compensation and adiposity in humans (2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982221011209)]
