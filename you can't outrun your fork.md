1. Donâ€™t hang out with runners. Youâ€™ll end up thinking all thin people have huge appetites!^[https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/17lomsj/comment/k7fmtf5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]
	1. Cyclists too! When I was at the peak of my cycle training I was eating anything and everything I wanted and still losing weight.
	   
	   I was riding about 16 hours a week minimum though. Thatâ€™s a shit-ton of calories being burnt.
	2. Used to do ultra distance running - after every 30-40km weekend run, I can _inhale_ half a lorry of food in one sitting while my non-running friends were like "wtf?" ðŸ˜‚
	3. used to room with a very avid cyclist- the kind who spends the whole day cycling. After a session, he would make a box of pasta and eat it all.
