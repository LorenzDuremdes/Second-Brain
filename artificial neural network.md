1. artificial neural networks, 2 basic principles (connectionism):
	1. any mental state can be described as an (N)-dimensional vector of numeric activation values over neural units in a network;
		1. non-uniform vector distribution → [[neural competition]]?
	2. [[human memory]] is created by modifying the strength of the connections between neural units. The connection strengths, or "weights", are generally represented as an N×N matrix.
