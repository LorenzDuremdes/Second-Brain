	1. things that tend toward (or cluster around) some kind of "natural" value (e.g. average human life span)
		1. makes use of "Gaussian distribution"
	2. things that don't follow "1"
		1. e.g. "power-law distributions" → e.g. population in a town, money
2. what's ironic about "Bayes"?
	1. For somebody who has had such an impact on the history of reasoning under uncertainty, Bayes’s own history remains ironically uncertain. He was born in 1701, or perhaps 1702, in the English county of Hertfordshire, or maybe it was London. And in either 1746, ’47, ’48, or ’49 he would write one of the most influential papers in all of mathematics, abandon it unpublished, and move on to other things.^[Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions, p. 137]
