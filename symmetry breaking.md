1. symmetry breaking; a phenomenon in which (infinitesimally) small fluctuations acting on a [[system]] crossing a critical point decide the [[system]]'s fate, by determining which branch of a bifurcation is taken^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_breaking]
2. A ball is initially located at the top of the central hill (C). This position is an unstable equilibrium: a very small perturbation will cause it to fall to one of the two stable wells left (L) or right (R). Even if the hill is symmetric and there is no reason for the ball to fall on either side, the observed final state is not symmetric.^[By Tigraan - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=48446175]
