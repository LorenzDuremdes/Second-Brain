1. cardiac output=heart rate*stroke volume
2. For a healthy person weighing 70 kg, the cardiac output at rest averages about 5 L/min; assuming a [[heart rate]] of 70 beats/min, the stroke volume would be approximately 70 ml.
3. Major factors influencing cardiac output – [[heart rate]] and stroke volume, both of which are also variable.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_output#cite_note-CNX2014-1]

4. maximum average cardiac output
	1. 25 liters per minute
	2. an elite aerobic athlete may have a value of 35 liters or higher^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 61]
5. legs → cardiac output
	1. your leg muscles become stronger and are able to pump [[blood]] with greater force
		1. This increase in contractility helps to increase the stroke volume, or the amount of [[blood|blood]] pumped with each [[heart]] beat.^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 61]

# stroke volume
6. Stroke volume also increases by improvements in your body’s ability to return [[blood]] from the body to the [[heart]], resulting in greater filling of the [[heart]] each time.^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 61]
7. stroke volume affects [[VO2 max]]
8. how to improve stroke volume?^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 19]
	1. long-duration workouts
	2. HIIT
