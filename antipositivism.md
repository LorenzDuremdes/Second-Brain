1. antipositivism (also **interpretivism**, **negativism** or **antinaturalism**); a theoretical stance which proposes that the social realm cannot be studied with the methods of investigation utilized within the natural sciences, and that investigation of the social realm requires a different [[epistemology]]. Fundamental to that antipositivist [[epistemology]] is the belief that the concepts and [[language]] researchers use in their research shape their perceptions of the social world they are investigating and seeking to define.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipositivism]
