1. muscle cells (synonym); muscle fibers
2. 
4. [[titin]] is a key receptor that triggers signaling that increases muscle fiber length^[https://www.facebook.com/StrengthandConditioningResearch/photos/a.314294568681572/3378449048932760?notif_id=1610354863885732&notif_t=notify_me_page&ref=notif]

# [[glycogen]]
1. how much [[glycogen]] does skeletal muscle contain?
	1. 1–2% of muscle mass 
		1. the skeletal muscle of an adult weighing 70 kg stores roughly 400 grams of [[glycogen]].^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen#cite_note-Glucose-Glycogen_storage_review-4]
2. muscle [[glycogen]] → aerobic performance
	1. the more muscle [[glycogen]], the higher the possible sustained aerobic performance^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 98]
3. muscle cells + glucose-6-phosphatase
	1. muscle cells lack glucose-6-phosphatase^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen#Muscle]
