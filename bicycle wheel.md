1. how high do you want the spoke tension to be (bicycle wheel)?
	1. a tension gauge is useful when building a wheel because you want the tension to be a certain value (**closish to the limit for the rim**) and it's hard to know that without a gauge (although you can sometimes do it by ear if you have a similar wheel to compare against)^[[What do you use to check spoke tension? : r/bikewrench (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bikewrench/comments/pzihtw/what_do_you_use_to_check_spoke_tension/)]
	   
	   Invest in a Park TM-1. Most manufacturers recommend 120 kgf max on the **high tension side (disc side for front, drive side for rear) unless you are building a rim brake front wheel in which case both sides should be about the same**.^[[What should my spoke tension be? : r/bikewrench (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bikewrench/comments/1br1svk/what_should_my_spoke_tension_be/)]
2. how to check if spoke tension is uniform?
	1. if you just want to check that tension is uniform on one side (it can vary from side to side) and you have a decent ear, plucking the spoke (and comparing notes) is fine. this is recommended by musson (famous reference on building wheels)
	   
	   a tension gauge is useful when building a wheel because you want the tension to be a certain value (closish to the limit for the rim) and it's hard to know that without a gauge (although you can sometimes do it by ear if you have a similar wheel to compare against). when you are just maintaining a wheel all you care about is relative tension - you need to find if any spoke is particularly loose so you can fix it.
	   
	   if you really want to spend money on something buy musson and educate yourself.^[[What do you use to check spoke tension? : r/bikewrench (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bikewrench/comments/pzihtw/what_do_you_use_to_check_spoke_tension/)]
2. what happens if the spoke tension is too low (bicycle wheel)?
	1. You need to increase the tension! When you ride the spoke tension varies, becoming the lowest when the spoke is pointing down.
	   
	   You can roughly reduce the tension with your weight.
	   
	   If the tension goes to zero, the spoke nipple will unthread itself during riding.^[[Question about spoke tension : r/wheelbuild (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wheelbuild/comments/11z01lb/question_about_spoke_tension/)]
