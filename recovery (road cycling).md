1. how big of a difference can fiber composition make on recovery ([[road cycling]])?
	1. a lot (15-fold within the same day)^[https://youtu.be/PZdcyRPsL0Y?t=3060]
		1. ◇doesn't necessarily mean those who are predominantly high-twitch have less potential → they might have to do less for the same fitness gains

# [[biochemistry]]
## [[carbohydrate]]
1. Recommendations for adequate post-exercise [[carbohydrate]] consumption are to consume 0.6–1.0 g/kg [[carbohydrate]] within 30 min of cessation of exercise and again every 2 h for the next 4–6 h (40, 41). [[Carbohydrate]] consumption of 1.2 g/kg every 30 min over 3.5 h also resulted in maximal [[glycogen]] replenishment (41, 42).^[[Effects of Protein Supplementation on Performance and Recovery in Resistance and Endurance Training - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6142015/)]

## [[protein]]
### post-workout
1. negative whole-body [[protein]] balance → post-endurance exercise
	1. Because prolonged bouts of endurance exercise (i.e., >2 h) result in considerable oxidation of amino acids, specifically [[leucine]], and intense or prolonged bouts of endurance exercise result in hypoxia-mediated small intestinal injury, negative whole-body [[protein]] balance may be common in endurance athletes (60–62). Because of this, [[protein]] requirements and recommendations for endurance athletes must consider more than MPS, especially since short-term increases in MPS do not fully explain the dynamics of long-term whole-body net [[protein]] balance and various training adaptations.^[Effects of Protein Supplementation on Performance and Recovery in Resistance and Endurance Training - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6142015/)

### research
1. [Protein and the Adaptive Response With Endurance Training: Wishful Thinking or a Competitive Edge? - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5974122/)
	1. the aim of this perspective is to discuss the current evidence on the role of dietary [[protein]] and the adaptive response with [[endurance training]]
