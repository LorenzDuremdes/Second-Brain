	1. if we were to use the regular, manual grooming of our relatives, we would have to spend around half (e.g. 42% in Dunbar 1993) of our time grooming, which is entirely unsustainable. [[Language]] is instead used (and evolved) to more economically fulfill that role. Linguistic gestures, especially small talk, largely overtake the role of manual grooming in humans.
	2. our **brains** seemingly respond to compliments and praise like they would to social grooming, except it’s a lot quicker and easier, and can happen at a distance^[Dumbar, R., ‘Co-evolution of neocortex size, group size and language in humans’, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 1993, 16(4), pp. 681–735]^[The Happy Brain: The Science of Where [[happiness]] Comes from, and Why, p. 99–100]
2. is "touch" more 'potent' than "language"?^[The Happy Brain: The Science of Where [[happiness]] Comes from, and Why, p. 100]
