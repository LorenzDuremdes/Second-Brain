1. alpha waves are reduced with open eyes and [[sleep]], while they are enhanced during drowsiness
   
   they can be predominantly recorded from the occipital lobes during wakeful relaxation with closed eyes
   
   the second occurrence of alpha wave activity is during [[REM sleep]]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_wave]
2. alpha wave intrusion ([[neurophysiology]]); occurs when the alpha waves appear with non-[[REM sleep]] when delta activity is expected
	1. has been attributed to studies where subjects report non-refreshing [[sleep]]
3. mindfulness → alpha waves
	1. mindfulness meditation has been shown to increase alpha wave power in both healthy subjects and patients.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_wave#cite_note-pmid26441373-16]
