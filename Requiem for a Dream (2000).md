Marion asks Harry if he’s going to come see her tonight and he says he will and that she should wait for him. They’re both crying during this scene because they’re clearly not going to see each other.
1. Personally it's just a roleplay of what they couldve been. Remembering what they were before since they cant go back to those days now. Also, the title.
2. They were both pretending their lives were better and mundane.

This makes me cry because he was her last hope, and he's trying so hard for her and they love each other so much but it just won't work

The ways these scenes are shot is masterful. You can really feel the distance between the 2 lovers who have only their addictions keeping them together. The way she sits down with him, but not even close to him, and looks over to him expectantly, hoping he might show some ounce of concern for her after what she did but ultimately recieving nothing but silence. This shows a complete disconnect between and how drugs have consumed their thoughts completely.

What people don't understand is that drugs weren't the problem but it was the their incapability to achieve their dream and knowing their incapability they needed an escape and that escape from reality came from drugs and eventually the drugs destroy them all . That's why the movie is called requiem for a dream .
