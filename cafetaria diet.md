1. In the early days, researchers would simply add [[fat]] to standard rodent chow. This worked, but it often took months to produce a portly rat ... Palatable human [[food]] is the most effective way to cause a normal rat to spontaneously overeat and become obese, and **its fattening effect cannot be attributed solely to its fat or sugar content** (i.e. [cafetaria diet](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33309818/))
