## Intelligence formula applied to [[dating]]

One way to use the intelligence formula, is to simply try to keep options as numerous as possible, especially positive ones (maximin and minimax).

E.g. presumptive statements (advised by Mark Manson’s “Models: Attract Women Through Honesty” as well) is one simple way to expand one’s positive pathways by surpassing psychological defense mechanisms.

The more options are eliminated (without necessarily eliminating future ones), the quicker one can go from “exploration” to “exploitation” as construal level decreases.

Principes

1.  Probeer jezelf af te vragen “Vind ik haar leuk?” of “Zou ik haar leuk vinden?” en daarachter proberen te komen i.p.v. “Vind zij mij leuk?”
2.  E.g. vragen “Wat zijn je hobby’s?”
3.  Het doel is om te kijken of jij waardevol kan zijn voor de ander en vice versa (i.p.v. een relatie)
4.  Verandert ook de interacties e.g. haar als persoon kennen i.p.v. alleen seksuele aantrekking

## The future me

The future me will be just as precise and detailed in approaching women as I currently am with road cycling. Dozens of metrics and other details will be used to improve my seduction skills faster than almost any human being on this planet.

I will be able to strategize based on all kinds of metrics just like I currently do trying to account for terrain (hills), dynamic wind, CdA, etc. in road cycling.

Progress will be meticulously tracked as to maximize it (process and product optimalism), as well as ensuring that I am making progress *in the first place*. Another benefit is increasing my ceiling by maintaining past knowledge via exponentially growing intervals, creating more space as time passes and practically making my potential infinite.

I will, soon, be able to craft strategies and tactics requiring most people consuming whole books (hundreds of hours) within mere seconds, near-realtime.

All that needs to be done and maintained is making this a consistent habit e.g. approaching at least 2 girls a day (or 12 a week accounting 1 rest day/week). Having this as a bottleneck stops/slows down (probably former) all other processes.
