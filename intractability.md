1. intractability; a problem that can be solved in theory (e.g. given large but finite resources, especially time), but for which in practice _any_ solution takes too many resources to be useful^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory#Intractability]
	1. an exponential-time [[algorithm]] that takes 1.0001<sup>n</sup> operations is practical until _n_ gets relatively large
2. clairvoyance â†’ intractability
	1. even with complete foreknowledge, finding the perfect schedule might be practically impossible^[Algorithms to Live By: The [[computer science]] of Human Decisions, p. 126]
		1. what about partial clairvoyance (half-life)?
