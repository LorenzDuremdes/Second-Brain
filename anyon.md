3. Well they only exist in 2d materials so maybe you might see them in graphene. What's also useful is they have a sort of memory so they could be used in quantum computers.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/kc0bkt/physicists_prove_anyons_exist_a_third_type_of/gfmj39s?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
