1. limbic system; responsible for sifting through and organizing lower order processing, and relaying sensory information to other [[brain]] areas for higher order emotional processing
	1. There is controversy over the use of the term limbic system, with scientists such as LeDoux arguing that the term be considered obsolete and abandoned.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbic_system#cite_note-LeDoux00-37]
	2. More important, the "boundaries" of the limbic system have been repeatedly redefined because of advances in neuroscience.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbic_system#cite_note-LeDoux00-37] Therefore, while it is true that limbic interacting structures are more closely related to [[emotion]], the limbic system itself is best thought of as a component of a larger emotional processing plant.<sup>[*citation needed*]</sup>

# neurophysiology
1. most of the limbic system is compromised of the [[temporal lobe]] especially the [[amygdala]] [[hippocampus|and hippoca]]mpus^[The Happy Brain: The Science of Where [[happiness]] Comes from, and Why, p. 126]

# [[ontogenesis]]
1. the limbic system is organized mainly during the first 6 years of life but continues to evolve in a use-dependent manner (Hebbian theory)^[The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 75]
