1. Hm.. I interpreted the kettle scene as just a way of representing Theodore's anger/jealousy towards the Alan Watts OS.
   
   Theodore was a bit hesitant to meet him when Samantha talked about him, (maybe it's my own insecurity projecting) and she explained how her and the Alan Watts OS have been struggling to figure out what they've been feeling, then she wanted some alone time to talk to the Alan Watts OS some more - Theodore must've felt a bit jealous because she's met someone who is as advanced as she is, and they're sharing a moment together that Theodore could never share with her.
