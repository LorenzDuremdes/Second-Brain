1. HPG axis; refers to the [[hypothalamus]], [[pituitary gland]], and [[gonad|gonadal glands]] as if these individual [[endocrine gland|endocrine glands]] were a single entity^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamic%E2%80%93pituitary%E2%80%93gonadal_axis]
	1. gonadal glands; gonad
2. [[stress|stressful]] stimuli^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7202382/]
- HPA axis releases [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] (CRH) from the hypothalamus
- when CRH reaches the pituitary, the latter releases [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH)
- triggers the secretion in the bloodstream of the steroid hormone [[glucocorticoid|glucocorticoids]] by the [[adrenal cortex]] ([[cortisol]] in primates and corticosterone in rodents)
	1. Glucocorticoids are essential for the adaptive response to stress, ultimately leading to the normalization of glucocorticoid release by the inhibition of the HPA axis activity through a negative feedback signal
5. The basal activity of the HPA axis, and therefore glucocorticoid release, is largely orchestrated by the [[circadian rhythm|internal circadian clock]] located in the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] of the hypothalamus and exhibits a daily rhythm in both humans and rodents

1. hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis; stimulates and modulates sexual desire via release of [[sexual intercourse]] hormones, namely [[testosterone]] from the testes for men and oestrogen from the ovaries for women^[The Happy Brain: The Science of Where [[happiness]] Comes from, and Why, p. 123]^[Goldstein, J. M., ‘[[sexual intercourse]], hormones and affective arousal circuitry dysfunction in schizophrenia’, Hormones and Behavior, 2006, 50(4), pp. 612–22]
