1. Simpson's paradox; a phenomenon in [[probability]] and [[statistics]] in which a trend appears in several groups of data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined
   
   The paradox can be resolved when confounding variables and causal relations are appropriately addressed in the statistical modeling (e.g., through cluster analysis).^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox]
