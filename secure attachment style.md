	1. I thought it I was in a healthy relationship (until the very end) and hindsight says otherwise. That up and down. I didn’t realize I was being manipulated. His behavior drastically changed the last few weeks. I look forward to a boring and healthy relationship next.
	2. This. I was with my ex for 13 years. It was hell on earth very abusive in every way. Finally got rid of him but left me in a bad way. I’m an alcoholic. Ptsd anxiety depression. But finally got away from him. Met my new partner and I didn’t know how to act so I kept messing up. But he never left me. Took me ages to realise what is normal and yep boring is normal.
