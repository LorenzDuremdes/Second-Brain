1. leavening agent; any one of a number of substances used in [[dough|doughs]] and [[batter (cooking)|batters]] that cause a foaming action (gas bubbles) that lightens and softens the [[mixture]].
   
   An alternative or supplement to leavening agents is mechanical action by which air is incorporated (i.e. kneading). Leavening agents can be biological or synthetic chemical compounds. The gas produced is often [[carbon dioxide]], or occasionally [[hydrogen]].
   
   Using a [[whisk]] on certain liquids, notably [[cream]] or [[egg white|egg whites]], can also create foams through mechanical action. This is the method employed in the making of sponge cakes, where an [[eggs as food|egg]] protein matrix produced by vigorous whipping provides almost all the structure of the finished product.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leavening_agent]
2. can you 'just throw in e.g. baking soda/powder' to aerate a dish + why
	1. if fat isn’t properly aerated, chemical leavening won’t make up for it. Baking soda and powder don’t introduce any new air bubbles into a batter. They simply help expand, via the release of carbon dioxide gas, air bubbles already in place.^[Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking (Samin Nosrat), p. 137]
	2. **ChatGPT: Limitations of Chemical Leaveners (Baking Soda & Baking Powder):**
	   - They do not create new bubbles:
	   Baking soda and baking powder generate CO₂ gas through chemical reactions (acid-base for soda; dual-stage acid reactions for powder).
	   However, this gas needs existing bubbles to expand into. The structure created during fat aeration or vigorous mixing is crucial.
	   - Without initial bubbles, the gas has nowhere to go → it either escapes or forms large, uneven pockets → leading to dense or poorly textured baked goods.
3. Some classic [[cake|cakes]] have no chemical leavening—that is, [[sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]] or [[baking powder]]—and rely entirely on whipped fat for their cloudlike structure. In pound cake, whipped [[butter]] and eggs do all the work of leavening. In génoise, a type of sponge cake, whipped eggs, whose [[yolk|fatty yolks]] entrap the air and protein-rich whites surround air pockets, allow the cake to rise. This is the only leavener. There is no baking powder, no baking soda, no yeast, and not even any creamed butter to help this cake rise! It is miraculous.^[Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking (Samin Nosrat), p. 136]
