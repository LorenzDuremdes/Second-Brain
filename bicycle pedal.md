# pedaling (technique)
1. which leg tends to contribute more power to pedaling ([[road cycling]])?
	1. the dominant leg^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 224]
2. standing vs. seated pedaling → efficiency + why
	1. efficiency seems to remain the same → standing requires more [[energy]] but also produces a higher power output^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 240]
		1. why do you still get more quickly tired standing?
			1. standing is difficult to do at low power output → tired more quickly (wouldn't be the case if you could?)
3. roughly 80 percent of [[energy]] from [[metabolism]] results in heat rather than mechanical power to the pedal^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 243]
## cadence·power output·torque
1. Low cadence, low power output, low torque (e.g: general group riding)^[https://sportsincycling.com/blog/motorpacing-all-you-need-to-know/]
2. high cadence, low power output, low torque (e.g: descending)^[https://sportsincycling.com/blog/motorpacing-all-you-need-to-know/]
3. low cadence, high power output, high torque (e.g: climbing)^[https://sportsincycling.com/blog/motorpacing-all-you-need-to-know/]

### uphill vs. downhill
1. it's more difficult to achieve maximum power output downhill ([[road cycling]])^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 184]
	1. your muscles are not used to such high power outputs at high cadence and low torque (pros have to practice e.g. motorpacing)
2. why is it more effective to push harder uphill and recover downhill?
	1. because it's more difficult for your muscles to achieve maximum power output at higher cadences and lower resistance (downhill) even when specifically training for it e.g. motorpacing^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 184]

## ankle
2. toes down = plantarflexed^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 225]
3. heels down = dorsiflexed^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 225]

## cadence
1. at what amount of watts is a higher cadence more beneficial ([[road cycling]])?
	1. $\text{>250 watts}$
	2. Overall, it appears that no single cadence is preferred; instead, cadence varies greatly depending on the terrain and race situation.^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 234]
	3. at ~40+ km/h?
		1. ![[40 kmh 250 watts road cycling.jpg]]
2. how can one's individual optimal cadence be found?
	1. watts produced + [[heart rate]] + respective cadence
	2. e.g.:

**test 1**:
cadence = 87 rpm
wattage = 265
HR = 172

**test 2**:
cadence = 97 RPM
wattage = 287
HR = 173

In this case, it’s highly likely that the higher cadence is more optimal for the athlete because he or she produced 22 watts more power with an increase of only 1 [[heart]] beat per minute when at 97 revolutions per minute.

Of course, you must do your best to minimize differences between the tests in variables such as weather, amount of rest, and time of day to make the test as controlled as possible. This simple test needs to be done across the multiple periods suggested because each period represents a different physiological system within the body.^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 235]

1. low intensity → cadence
	1. might be more efficient to have a lower cadence (50–60 RPM) at lower intensities^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 235]
2. high power output → cadence
	1. 80–100 RPM seems to be most efficient and effective^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 236]
3. reasons why a very high cadence (120+ RPM) might be less efficient and effective:
	1. Greater [[energy]] was required simply to move the legs at the higher [[speed]], therefore causing greater fatigue (although the cyclist may be pushing against less resistance with each pedal stroke, more [[energy]] is used to move 120 times compared with 100 times, even against no resistance).
	2. The higher [[speed]] of movement caused greater recruitment of fast-twitch muscle fibers, which are less efficient aerobically and produce more lactic [[acid]].^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 237]

4. it could be more efficient to have a lower cadence in the beginning and higher in the end (e.g. SST)^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 238]
	1. why? because you usually tend to sprint in the end (80–100 cadence is more efficient at higher power outputs)
