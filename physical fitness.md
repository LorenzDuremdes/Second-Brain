1. increased fitness and heat acclimatization generally increases sweating rates^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 250]
2. "**fatigue** is concomitant with **fitness**" is related to "**DOMS** is concomitant with **[[muscle hypertrophy]]**"
3. fatigue drops faster than fitness
4. form (etymology); from a sheet of paper—a form—with a list of all of the horses racing that day and how they had performed recently
	
	You would then pick one to put your money on because on the form that horse appeared to be racing well. Bike racing, which started at about the same time in Europe, also was a betting [[sport]], with similar forms. So bike racing adopted the word. Over the next century, other sports also began to talk about form. Now it seems that every [[sport]], from bike racing to bowling, uses that word to describe athletes’ event readiness.^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 15]

# [[physiology]]
1. fatigue resistance → growth potential^[How Much Should I Train by Dr. Mike Israetel and Dr. James Hoffmann, p. 17]
	1. the former usually decreases the latter e.g. as seen in predominantly slower-twitch muscle fibers people
