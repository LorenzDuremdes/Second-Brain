## compression garments
1. The use of COMP (compression garments) between 12 – 80mins has been shown to improve subsequent 5-min maximal cycling mean and max power output, 30s cycling mean power and 30-min cycling mean power (Argus et al. 2013; Chatard et al. 2004; Driller and Halson 2013; Ménétrier et al. 2013)
## cold [[water]] immersion
1. CWI (cold [[water]] immersion) used for 5-mins at 14°C following 25-mins of submaximal cycling has been shown to improve 4-km TT [[time]] to completion in the heat and average power output (Peiffer et al. 2008a). CWI used for 14-15mins at 15°C appears advantageous for improving 9-15min TT total work performed and repeated sprint power output (Vaile et al. 2008a; Vaile et al. 2008b; Vaile et al. 2011). CWI also appears more beneficial than AR at improving total work performed (Vaile et al. 2011).
## contrast [[water]] therapy
1. CWT (contrast [[water]] therapy) used between 6-14mins with 38°C HWI and 15°C CWI and a ratio of cold:hot 1:1- mins or 1:2-mins, could increase subsequent TT total work performed, TT & sprint mean power output and sprint PPO (Ménétrier et al. 2013; Vaile et al. 2008b). This performance benefit from CWT has been observed from durations as short as a 15s sprint and up to a 15- min TT (Ménétrier et al. 2013; Vaile et al. 2008b).
## humidification and electromyostimulation
1. Both HUM (humidification) and EMS (electromyostimulation) may be able to attenuate the decrement in 30s sprint mean power (Argus et al. 2013).
## [[sport]] massage with ozonized oil
1. SMOZO ([[sport]] massage with ozonized oil) may assist [[time]] trial cycling performance (Paoli et al. 2013) and SM may improve anaerobic cycling mean power and reduce 5-km TT [[time]] to completion (Bielik 2010; Monedero and Donne 2000).
## [[active recovery]]
1. AR has been shown to attenuate 15s sprint PPO (peak power output), 5km TT [[time]] to completion and even increase 30s sprint cycling mean power and PPO (Bielik 2010; Connolly et al. 2003; Monedero and Donne 2000).
### [[active recovery]]*[[sport]] massage
1. A combination of recovery strategies should be explored further, as AR ([[active recovery]]) and SM ([[sport]] massage) combined, were more beneficial than AR or SM alone, at reducing 5-km TT [[time]] to completion (Monedero and Donne 2000).
## static stretching
1. The use of SS (static stretching) did not inhibit anaerobic cycling performance when performed for 3 x 30s per muscle and leg (Kingsley et al. 2013) and may be a useful strategy for improving RoM and reducing the risk of [[knee]] injury when performed on the quadriceps muscle group, hamstrings muscle group and I.T.B between cycling exercise bouts (Asplund and St Pierre 2004).
