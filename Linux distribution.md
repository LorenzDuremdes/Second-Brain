# [[Lubuntu]] vs. [[Xubuntu]]
1. the former is more lightweight^[https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/pa465z/xubuntu_vs_lubuntu/]
	1. So far [[Lubuntu]] uses less [[memory]] and can be configured to turn off un-needed startup programs to bring it down even more.
2. Subsequent reviewers emphasized [[Xubuntu]]'s perceived deficiencies in performance to highlight [[Lubuntu]], a project with similar goals but using the LXDE desktop environment (now LXQt) as opposed to Xfce. For instance, Damien Oh of Make Tech Easier noted in May 2010, "So what about [[Xubuntu]]? isn't it supposed to be the lightweight equivalent of [[Ubuntu]]? Sadly, that is a thing of the past. The truth is, the supposed lightweight equivalent is not lightweight at all. While [[Xubuntu]] is using the lightweight XFCE desktop environment, it had been bugged down by several heavyweight applications and also the integration with GNOME desktop also makes it lose its advantage".^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xubuntu#Performance]
