1. mutation (genetic algorithm); a genetic operator used to maintain genetic diversity from one generation of a population of genetic algorithm chromosomes to the next^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_(genetic_algorithm)]

	In mutation, the solution may change entirely from the previous solution. Hence GA can come to a better solution by using mutation.
	
	Mutation occurs during evolution according to a user-definable (â—‡can also be "adaptive [[learning rate]]) mutation probability. This probability should be set low. If it is set too high, the search will turn into a primitive random search.
