1. average [[muscle]]-to-[[bone]] ratio in [[animal|animals]] (and theoretical maximum muscle support per mass of bone)
	1. **ChatGPT**
	   In biomechanics, the muscle-to-bone ratio is typically around 4:1 in many animals, meaning 1 kg of bone could support ~4 kg of muscle.
	   
	   The maximum muscle mass 1 kg of bone supports depends on bone strength and geometry. Rough estimates suggest a muscle-to-bone ratio of 4:1 in many species, meaning 1 kg of bone could support around 4 kg of muscle.
	   
	   The maximum muscle mass 1 kg of bone can support depends on bone geometry, muscle force production, and scaling. Rough estimates suggest muscle-to-bone ratios of 20-30 times mass, with some theoretical maxima up to 40-50 kg of muscle for 1 kg of bone in optimal conditions. However, practical limits, bone safety, and muscle attachment areas reduce this. For typical [[human]] bodies, 1 kg of bone commonly supports about 2.7 kg of muscle, but under ideal conditions, it could be higher, potentially 20-30 kg.
	   
	   The maximum muscle mass a bone can support depends on several factors like geometry and attachment area. In an optimally designed skeleton, 1 kg of bone could theoretically support around 30-40 kg of muscle. However, biological constraints, like [[tendon]] attachment areas and leverage, reduce this ratio. In reality, living organisms typically have a 1:2 or 1:3 muscle-to-bone ratio. For example, in birds, the pectoral muscles are large compared to their light bones. The numbers can vary widely depending on species and bone design.
	   
	   In real animals the numbers are much lower because bones must serve many functions, and nature builds in safety margins. For example, in humans the [[skeleton]] is roughly 15% of body weight while the muscles make up closer to 40%—a ratio of only about 2–3 kg muscle per kg bone.
	   
	   So while a “theoretical maximum” might be in the tens‐of‐kilograms per kilogram range, actual muscle–bone ratios in living creatures are far more conservative.
	2. In measurements of thousands of elite athletes from soccer to weight lifting, wrestling, boxing, judo, rugby, and more, Holway has found that each kilogram (2.2 pounds) of bone supports a maximum of five kilograms (11 pounds) of muscle. Five-to-one, then, is a general limit of the human muscle bookcase. The limit Holway has documented for [[women]] is closer to 4.2 to 1. And both limits are sans steroids. **Athletes on steroids have been able to surpass the 5 to 1 upper bound**.^[The Sports Gene: Inside the Science of Extraordinary Athletic Performance, p. 119, 344]
