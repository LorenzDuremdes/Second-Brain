1. does [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]] 'allow' free will?
	1. According to many interpretations, indeterminism enables free will to exist, while others assert the opposite (because the action was not controllable by the physical being who claims to possess the free will).^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will]
	2. All the probabilistic version means is that it is impossible to precisely predict the future, no matter how much [[information]] you have. The best you could do is generate probabilities. It doesn't somehow endow minds with the ability to create uncaused outcomes. Randomness doesn't enable free will any more than determinism does.^[[Quantum Physics and Free Will : r/AskPhysics (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/8toqmq/quantum_physics_and_free_will/)]
