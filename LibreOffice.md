## https://www.reddit.com/r/libreoffice/comments/syooi6/what_can_libreoffice_do_that_microsoft_office_cant/
1. built-in Python interpreter
2. better ODF (OpenDocument) compatibility (can open it in web e.g. Gmail as well as opposed to .docx) + Linux
3. backward compatibility + free updates
4. stability (e.g. >100 pages)^[https://www.reddit.com/r/libreoffice/comments/syooi6/comment/i493f13/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
5. better security (updates)
7. My favorite thing, from experience, was note taking in engineering using the formula tool and being able to enter formula as fast as the prof was writing it on the board. People looking over my shoulder were amazed seeing these fully formatted formula popping up in my notes.

8. LibreOffice is the more active project with more developers. It's the standard office suite on all the major Linux distros. For security, not sure what you are looking for out of an office suite, but neither LibreOffice or OpenOffice tracks users. Libre, being the more active of the two with more developers, larger install base, and supported by the major Linux distros is more secure as there is more eyes on the code so bugs/vulnerabilities are found faster.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/us39m1/comment/i91g86e/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
