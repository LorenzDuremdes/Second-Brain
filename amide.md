2. amide; a compound with the general formula R−C(=O)−NR′R″, where R, R', and R″ represent any group, typically organyl groups or [[hydrogen]] atoms. The amide group is called a [[peptide bond]] when it is part of the main chain of a protein, and an isopeptide bond when it occurs in a side chain, as in asparagine and glutamine.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amide]
