1. dulce de leche; a [[confectionery]] popular in Latin America, [[France]], Poland, and the Philippines prepared by slowly heating [[sugar]] and [[milk]] over several hours. The substance takes on a spreadable, sauce-like consistency and derives its rich flavour and colour from non-enzymatic browning. It is typically used to top or fill other sweet foods.
   
   In French, it is called confiture de lait ([[milk]] jam). In France, it is traditional in the regions of [[Normandy]] and Savoy, where it is commonly served with fromage blanc or [[crêpe|crêpes]].^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulce_de_leche]
