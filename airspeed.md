# [[road cycling]]
1. a lower airspeed is more efficient (pacing-wise, because it means that you spent less [[energy]] going at higher actual speeds
	1. airspeed lower than actual [[speed]] means you were more than 100% efficient
2. what metric can you use to determine the [[global optimum]] of power output tailwind ↮ headwind?
	1. airspeed

		◇you probably want it as close as possible to actual [[speed]] (0% airspeed advantage) → airspeed being 'converted' into actual [[speed]]
