	1. Pure sound. Pure silence. Pure bliss.
	   
	   Lose yourself in [[music]]. Find yourself in silence. Beoplay H95 is all about depth, detail and delight. From sound to finish.
	   
	   **Standout sound quality**
	   Custom titanium drivers – nestled under detachable magnetic earcups – are tuned for outstanding fidelity. It's done under the watchful ear of our in-house [[Tonmeister]]. The result? More lush lows, punchier mids and crisper highs. Put simply, you'll hear magical details you've never heard before.
	   
	   **Crafted for the senses**
	   You can see it in the soft lambskin leather, picked and stitched with exacting attention to detail. You can feel it in the precision-cut aluminium frame that's robust yet beautiful. Even the carry case tells the story. Timeless design, made to last for generations.
	   
	   **Awards and reviews**
	   So what does spending the equivalent of two pairs of the outstanding Sony WH-1000XM4 get you? The Beoplay H95 takes almost a century’s worth of [[Bang & Olufsen]]’s very specific talents and condenses them into a pair of [[headphones]] that combine aural and tactile gratification in a way that’s without obvious comparison.^[[Bang & Olufsen Beoplay H95 review: Perfect headphones | British GQ (gq-magazine.co.uk)](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/lifestyle/article/bang-and-olufsen-beoplay-h95-review)]
	   
	2. Every bit the premium pair of wireless [[headphones]], this [[Bang & Olufsen]] Beoplay H95 review won’t be for everyone...  because these are so expensive it won’t be for many people actually, but if you’re willing to spend this much then it will be _oh-so-worth-it_.
	   
	  As you might expect, they absolutely scream sophistication. The [[Bang & Olufsen]] Beoplay H95 are excellent. They’re luxurious, they sound amazing and the smartphone app gives you a good amount of control.^[[Bang & Olufsen Beoplay H95 review | T3](https://www.t3.com/reviews/bang-and-olufsen-beoplay-h95-review)]

	1. The H95 is indeed a punchy pair o' phones. Transients are very fast all across the board, and that's probably the main reason why the mids don't sound as recessed as the graph would suggest, along with the fact that you almost get no range of frequencies bleeding into another, which is indeed saying a lot. How they managed to achieve that with a single 40mm dynamic driver is really hard to explain for me.  
Positioning is also definitely more that just "not bad", and I'm comparing it to a king-in-positioning pair of IEMs like the ThieAudio Monarch here, so I know what I'm talking about. Soundstage is also pretty wide for a closed-back set.
2. how can you experience the same song 'more than once'?
	1. switch between EQ settings (or turn it off on the Bang and Olufsen Beoplay H95)

1. With H95 I’m listening to it with ease. Trailing notes of tones go _that much_ deeper, silence is _not_ empty. There’s always more sound, no matter how subtle.^[[I picked up both the Beoplay H95 and the Airpods Max. : r/BangandOlufsen (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BangandOlufsen/comments/rzmtkx/i_picked_up_both_the_beoplay_h95_and_the_airpods/)]
2. They actually sound as good as my home system at 1/8th the price^[https://www.amazon.com/Comfortable-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphones-Protective/product-reviews/B0916FSJ41/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=3]
3. I thought, man, that's weird. They dont cost as much as the H95s, but they're still quite expensive and should sound much better than they do. This made me think for a minute, and then I pulled out all the other [[headphones]] and earbuds I have.

	This was when I realized how bad things were about to be for me. My main PC [[headphones]] had been the Bose QC 35 ii's and while they didn't sound insanely good, they had always sounded decent.

	Had.

	Then I went through my many sets of earbuds, and one by one I realized they all sounded like utter garbage. What the hell happened? I don't skimp on earbuds, and they all sounded pretty damn good before.

	Then it hit me. The H95s are just that good. The reason they didn't wow me immediately was because they aren't tuned to be these bass thumping experiences, they just play the sound how it's actually supposed to sound and nothing else even comes CLOSE.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/BangandOlufsen/comments/rzmtkx/i_picked_up_both_the_beoplay_h95_and_the_airpods/]
3. Biggest difference though is probably the level of detail. Among wireless [[headphones]] the H95 is currently in a league of its own and can give many wired [[headphones]] a run for their money.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/iwcho6/comment/g600mss/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
4. I have BeoLab 20's in the living room and I remember when I got them, I started to listen all my music again, because I heard so much more detail.
   
   The same is happening now with the H95. I hear sounds I never heard before, I hear tears in voices I never heard before and I hear bad studios that frankly destroy the [[music]] ;-).
   
   Movies too are incredible - the H95 goes so low on the sound spectrum, it really feels like being in the cinema.^[[This H95 is truly amazing... : r/BangandOlufsen (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BangandOlufsen/comments/185dh6z/this_h95_is_truly_amazing/)]
5. Yup agreed. And I have a few of the higher end [[headphones]]. Focal Bathys, B&W Px8, Master & Dynamic MW75. The H95 totally hold their own, if not better, livelier and/or more well balanced.^[[Bought new H95’s : r/BangandOlufsen (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BangandOlufsen/comments/12j5g7k/bought_new_h95s/)]

## versus Sony
1. H95 has a very flat/audiophile curve, while the XM4 is much more bass heavy^[https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/iwcho6/comment/g600mss/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]

# versus Apple
1. I agree I purchased mine a few weeks ago and it blows my AirPods Pro and girlfriends AirPods Max out of the water.^[[Bought new H95’s : r/BangandOlufsen (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BangandOlufsen/comments/12j5g7k/bought_new_h95s/)]
