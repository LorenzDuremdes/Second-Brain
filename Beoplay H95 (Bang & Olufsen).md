1. With H95 I’m listening to it with ease. Trailing notes of tones go _that much_ deeper, silence is _not_ empty. There’s always more sound, no matter how subtle.^[[I picked up both the Beoplay H95 and the Airpods Max. : r/BangandOlufsen (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BangandOlufsen/comments/rzmtkx/i_picked_up_both_the_beoplay_h95_and_the_airpods/)]
2. They actually sound as good as my home system at 1/8th the price^[https://www.amazon.com/Comfortable-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphones-Protective/product-reviews/B0916FSJ41/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=3]
3. I thought, man, that's weird. They dont cost as much as the H95s, but they're still quite expensive and should sound much better than they do. This made me think for a minute, and then I pulled out all the other [[headphones]] and earbuds I have.

	This was when I realized how bad things were about to be for me. My main PC [[headphones]] had been the Bose QC 35 ii's and while they didn't sound insanely good, they had always sounded decent.

	Had.

	Then I went through my many sets of earbuds, and one by one I realized they all sounded like utter garbage. What the hell happened? I don't skimp on earbuds, and they all sounded pretty damn good before.

	Then it hit me. The H95s are just that good. The reason they didn't wow me immediately was because they aren't tuned to be these bass thumping experiences, they just play the sound how it's actually supposed to sound and nothing else even comes CLOSE.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/BangandOlufsen/comments/rzmtkx/i_picked_up_both_the_beoplay_h95_and_the_airpods/]
3. Biggest difference though is probably the level of detail. Among wireless [[headphones]] the H95 is currently in a league of its own and can give many wired [[headphones]] a run for their money.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/iwcho6/comment/g600mss/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
4. I have BeoLab 20's in the living room and I remember when I got them, I started to listen all my music again, because I heard so much more detail.
   
   The same is happening now with the H95. I hear sounds I never heard before, I hear tears in voices I never heard before and I hear bad studios that frankly destroy the [[music]] ;-).
   
   Movies too are incredible - the H95 goes so low on the sound spectrum, it really feels like being in the cinema.^[[This H95 is truly amazing... : r/BangandOlufsen (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BangandOlufsen/comments/185dh6z/this_h95_is_truly_amazing/)]
5. Yup agreed. And I have a few of the higher end [[headphones]]. Focal Bathys, B&W Px8, Master & Dynamic MW75. The H95 totally hold their own, if not better, livelier and/or more well balanced.^[[Bought new H95’s : r/BangandOlufsen (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BangandOlufsen/comments/12j5g7k/bought_new_h95s/)]

## versus Sony
1. H95 has a very flat/audiophile curve, while the XM4 is much more bass heavy^[https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/iwcho6/comment/g600mss/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]

# versus Apple
1. I agree I purchased mine a few weeks ago and it blows my AirPods Pro and girlfriends AirPods Max out of the water.^[[Bought new H95’s : r/BangandOlufsen (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BangandOlufsen/comments/12j5g7k/bought_new_h95s/)]

1. putting on [[headphones]] > song at the end (low volume) > thought it came from my laptop (surround was on)
