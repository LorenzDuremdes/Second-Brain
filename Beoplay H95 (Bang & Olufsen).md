1. They actually sound as good as my home system at 1/8th the price^[https://www.amazon.com/Comfortable-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphones-Protective/product-reviews/B0916FSJ41/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=3]
2. I thought, man, that's weird. They dont cost as much as the H95s, but they're still quite expensive and should sound much better than they do. This made me think for a minute, and then I pulled out all the other [[headphones]] and earbuds I have.

	This was when I realized how bad things were about to be for me. My main PC [[headphones]] had been the Bose QC 35 ii's and while they didn't sound insanely good, they had always sounded decent.

	Had.

	Then I went through my many sets of earbuds, and one by one I realized they all sounded like utter garbage. What the hell happened? I don't skimp on earbuds, and they all sounded pretty damn good before.

	Then it hit me. The H95s are just that good. The reason they didn't wow me immediately was because they aren't tuned to be these bass thumping experiences, they just play the sound how it's actually supposed to sound and nothing else even comes CLOSE.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/BangandOlufsen/comments/rzmtkx/i_picked_up_both_the_beoplay_h95_and_the_airpods/]
3. Biggest difference though is probably the level of detail. Among wireless [[headphones]] the H95 is currently in a league of its own and can give many wired [[headphones]] a run for their money.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/iwcho6/comment/g600mss/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
