current movie criteria (-0.5 star per bad area or -1 for very bad):
1. does it have a longer-lasting impact or was it inspirational (e.g. lessons or wanting to see prequels/sequels/similar movies)?  
2. I wrote automotive criticism for about six years, and my review process was to first determine what the car was intending to do, and then evaluate it based on how well it did that.
   
   It's a bit more nebulous with film (or any art), but I think the general philosophy holds up.[https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/s/mTIsHXgHaj]  
    1. e.g. something about an actual historical event doesn't have to be 100% factually correct to make a statement e.g. feminism (e.g. _Cabrini (2024)_ did this well
3. sound design (e.g. _Dune (2024)_ did this well)  
4. cinematography (e.g. _Portrait de la jeune fille en feu (2019)_ did this well)  
5. immersion (does it make you feel like you are actually 'there')? E.g. _The Last Duel (2021)_ did this well  
6. plot (development) and coherence e.g. are they making (illogically) dumb decisions or not e.g. happened frequently in _Life (2017)_  
    1. logical dumb decisions e.g. human error, stress, or simply human emotions are still logical and coherent  
    2. engagement e.g. does it feel like no time has passed (e.g. _The Taste of Things (2023)_ did this well)
