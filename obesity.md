1. the difference in calorie intake between a lean and an overweight person of the same gender and height is about 10 percent. Assuming two beers provide 300 Calories, and the average lean person requires about 2,400 Calories to maintain weight, two beers is more than enough to bridge the calorie gap between lean and overweight^[The Hungry Brain (Stephan J. Guyenet, Ph.D.), p. 380]
2. why could the statement "we eat an average excess of 218 Calories" and e.g. "we need to eat 218 Calories less or burn 218 Calories extra (30m jogging/d)" be incorrect / worse than stated?
	1. If we average 218 excess Calories, what that really means is that some people don’t overeat at all, while others overeat by 400 Calories or more per day. And the latter population is the one that public health measures would have to target. Humble arithmetic suggests that halfhearted efforts aren’t going to cut it.^[The Hungry Brain (Stephan J. Guyenet, Ph.D.), p. 237]

# [[physiology]]
## [[leptin]]
1. Although [[leptin]] reduces [[appetite]] as a circulating signal, obese individuals generally exhibit a higher circulating concentration of leptin than normal weight individuals due to their higher [[body fat percentage|percentage body fat]]. These people show resistance to leptin, similar to resistance of insulin in type 2 diabetes, with the elevated levels failing to control hunger and modulate their weight.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin#Obesity]
2. We now know that one of the signals that told the rats to stop eating is a [[hormone]] called leptin, which is produced in the fat tissue and detected by the [[hypothalamus]] in the brain.^[Ultra-Processed People The Science Behind the Food That Isnt Food (Chris van Tulleken), p. 94 > Hervey GR. The effects of lesions in the hypothalamus in parabiotic rats. J Physiol. 1959 Mar]

# behavior
1. Weight loss maintainers had physical activity thermogenesis of roughly 12 kcal/kg/d as compared to weight regainers with approximately 8 kcal/kg/d, which was reflectetd by a significant negative correlation of body mass regain and physical activity levels (114)^[[Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis in Human Energy Homeostasis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279077/)]
