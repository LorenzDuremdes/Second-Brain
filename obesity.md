1. the difference in calorie intake between a lean and an overweight person of the same gender and height is about 10 percent. Assuming two beers provide 300 Calories, and the average lean person requires about 2,400 Calories to maintain weight, two beers is more than enough to bridge the calorie gap between lean and overweight^[The Hungry Brain (Stephan J. Guyenet, Ph.D.), p. 380]
2. why could the statement "we eat an average excess of 218 Calories" and e.g. "we need to eat 218 Calories less or burn 218 Calories extra (30m jogging/d)" be incorrect / worse than stated?
	1. If we average 218 excess Calories, what that really means is that some people don’t overeat at all, while others overeat by 400 Calories or more per day. And the latter population is the one that public health measures would have to target. Humble arithmetic suggests that halfhearted efforts aren’t going to cut it.^[The Hungry Brain (Stephan J. Guyenet, Ph.D.), p. 237]

## [[leptin]]
1. Although [[leptin]] reduces [[appetite]] as a circulating signal, obese individuals generally exhibit a higher circulating concentration of leptin than normal weight individuals due to their higher [[body fat percentage|percentage body fat]]. These people show resistance to leptin, similar to resistance of insulin in type 2 diabetes, with the elevated levels failing to control hunger and modulate their weight.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin#Obesity]
2. We now know that one of the signals that told the rats to stop eating is a [[hormone]] called leptin, which is produced in the fat tissue and detected by the [[hypothalamus]] in the brain.^[Ultra-Processed People The Science Behind the Food That Isnt Food (Chris van Tulleken), p. 94 > Hervey GR.

# behavior
1. Weight loss maintainers had physical activity thermogenesis of roughly 12 kcal/kg/d as compared to weight regainers with approximately 8 kcal/kg/d, which was reflectetd by a significant negative correlation of body mass regain and physical activity levels (114)^[[Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis in Human Energy Homeostasis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279077/)]

## [[non-exercise activity thermogenesis]]
1. A substantial percentage of this variability is explained by differences in spontaneous physical activity including “fidgeting” (29). Fidgeting-like activities accounted for a range in energy expenditure of 100-800 kcal per day in the subjects.
   
   In their “weight clamping” study, Leibel et al. (73) overfed adults who were lean and overweight/obese by 10%, or approximately with 5000-8000 kcal per day over 4-10 weeks, followed by a weight maintenance period. Body composition, fecal caloric loss, TEE, REE, TEF and spontaneous physical activity were measured using multiple technical approaches including indirect calorimetry, the doubly labeled water method, and activity trackers in a subgroup (73). They showed that maintaining a 10% elevated body mass induced a significant increase of TEE by 9±7 kcal per kg LBM per day in subjects who had not been previously obese and by 8±4 kcal per kg LBM per day in those who had formerly been obese (73). The majority of this rise in TEE was attributable to non-resting energy expenditure. The magnitude of this effect was comparable in those who had previously not been obese and those who had been overweight or obese, indicating similar adaptations to overfeeding conditions (73). However, a related review pointed out the large inter-individual variability regarding the capability to adjust energy expenditure with overfeeding in the “weight clamping” experiments (46) and emphasized that in other human over-feeding studies there is a wide range of individual weight gain per unit of excessively consumed energy. Therefore, it can be proposed that some individuals show a remarkable capacity to increase energy expenditure in response to overfeeding, while others do not (46). It was further suggested that spontaneous physical activity, and accordingly NEAT, likely play an important role regarding the impact on body weight under such conditions.^[[Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis in Human Energy Homeostasis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279077/)|]
