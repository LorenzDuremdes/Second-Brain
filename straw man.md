1. straw man; a form of argument and an [[informal fallacy]] of having the impression of refuting an argument, whereas the real subject of the argument was not addressed or refuted, but instead replaced with a false one.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#cite_note-Stephen_Downes-1]

# example
1. A: We should relax the laws on beer.
	B: No, any society with unrestricted access to intoxicants loses its work ethic and goes only for immediate gratification.

	The original proposal was to relax laws on beer. Person B has misconstrued/misrepresented this proposal by responding to it as if it had been "unrestricted access to intoxicants". It is a logical fallacy because Person A never advocated allowing said unrestricted access to intoxicants (this is also a slippery slope argument).
