   In a pot, add milk and butter. The ratios will vary depending on the fat content of your milk and butter, there's articles online that go into it. Heat just enough so the butter melts, do not boil it.
   
   Add it to the food processor and blitz the daylights out of it. You can also use an immersion blender.
   
   What you're doing here is forcing the butter molecules and milk molecules back together so it's nice and homogenized. Without forcing them together, the butter and milk will eventually separate as it cools.
   
   Do this correctly and you can make cream of any fat content you want.
   
   Make sure the butter is UNsalted
