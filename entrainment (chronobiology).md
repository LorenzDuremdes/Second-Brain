1. entrainment ([[chronobiology]]); occurs when rhythmic physiological or behavioral events match their period to that of an environmental oscillation^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrainment_(chronobiology)]
   
   It is ultimately the interaction between [[circadian rhythm|circadian rhythms]] and the environment. A central example is the entrainment of circadian rhythms to the daily light–dark cycle, which ultimately is determined by the Earth's rotation.

1. When light activates NMDA receptors in the SCN, [[CLOCK gene]] expression in that region is altered and the SCN is reset, and this is how entrainment occurs.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_effects_on_circadian_rhythm#cite_note-Yan_2009-12]
