1. entrainment (chronobiology); occurs when rhythmic physiological or behavioral events match their period to that of an environmental oscillation^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrainment_(chronobiology)]
   
   It is ultimately the interaction between [[circadian rhythm|circadian rhythms]] and the environment. A central example is the entrainment of circadian rhythms to the daily light–dark cycle, which ultimately is determined by the Earth's rotation.
