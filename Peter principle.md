1. Peter principle; a concept in management developed by Laurence J. Peter, which observes that people in a hierarchy tend to rise to "a level of respective incompetence": employees are promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to another.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle#cite_note-:0-1]
