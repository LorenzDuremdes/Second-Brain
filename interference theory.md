# [[human memory|short- and long-term memory]]
1. interference → short vs. long-term [[human memory]]
	1. interference mostly happens in long-term [[human memory]]?
		1. e.g. "coefficient of associability" → similar items are more easily memorized, short term

# deliberate interference
1. using interference to learn faster e.g. expanding hypotheses/lists (e.g. in Anki)
