1. nonbenzodiazepine; a class of psychoactive drugs that are [[benzodiazepine]]-like in uses, such as for treating [[insomnia]] and [[anxiety]]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonbenzodiazepine]
	1. Z-drugs (as many of their names begin with the letter "z")
2. More recently, a range of non-sedating [[anxiolytic]] drugs derived from the same structural families as the Z-drugs have been developed, such as alpidem (Ananxyl) and [[pagoclone]], and approved for clinical prescription. **Nonbenzodiazepine drugs are much more selective than the older [[benzodiazepine]] anxiolytics, producing effective relief of [[anxiety]]/panic with little or no sedation, anterograde amnesia, or [[anticonvulsant]] effects, and are thus potentially more precise than older, anti-[[anxiety]] drugs.**
   
   However, [[anxiolytic]] nonbenzodiazepines are not widely prescribed and many have collapsed after initial clinical trials and consumption halted many projects, including but not limited to alpidem, indiplon, and suriclone.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonbenzodiazepine]
