1. locality-sensitive hashing; an algorithmic technique that hashes similar input items into the same "buckets" with high [[probability]].^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing#cite_note-MOMD-1]
	1. the number of buckets is much smaller than the universe of possible input items.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing#cite_note-MOMD-1]
	2. applicabilities? ◇e.g. [[learning rate]]
	3. why "(with) high [[probability]]"?
		1. has to be with high [[probability]] ↮ happens with high [[probability]]?
