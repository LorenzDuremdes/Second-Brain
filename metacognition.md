1. metacognition → [[algorithmic efficiency]]
	1. metacognition is an example of increasing [[algorithmic efficiency]]

# [[concept network]]
1. how could e.g. "X → Y" make you think faster than e.g. "why is it that... when..."? ([[Anki]])
	1. you have to recall/activate a lot less to activate concepts

# [[explore-exploit trade-off]]
1. [[explore-exploit trade-off]] → maintenance
	1. maintenance is mostly exploiting, which makes it much more efficient
		1. with exploring, you can make errors more easily (e.g. incorrect pathway)

# [[neurophysiology]]
## [[neural pathway]]
1. consolidating thought patterns slowly over [[time]] (by bringing it to higher [[cache]] hierarchies) by increasing specificity/details is related to:
	1. explore/expl[[trade-off|oit trade]]-off
	2. why shouldn't you immediately consolidate **everything**?
		1. due to the possibility of excluding more efficient pathways

1. executive functions
2. [[cache hierarchy]]
	1. metacognition usually has a higher [[cache hierarchy]] than [[cognition]] if the former is (partially) activated to guide the latter
