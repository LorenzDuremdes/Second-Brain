1. Obree attacked Moser's record, on 16 July 1993, at the Vikingskipet velodrome in Norway. He failed by nearly a kilometre. He had booked the track for 24 hours and decided to come back the next day. The writer Nicholas Roe said:

	To stop his aching body seizing up, Obree then took the unusual measure of drinking pint upon pint of water so that he had to wake up to go to the lavatory every couple of hours through the night. Each time he got up, he stretched his muscles. On the next weary day, he was up and out within minutes, at the deserted velodrome by 7:55 am and on the track ready to start just five minutes after that. He had barely slept. He had punished his body hugely the previous day. Surely this was a waste of time?
	
	Obree said:
	I was Butch Cassidy in terms of swagger. I didn't want any negativity. This was blitzkrieg. I'm going in there. Let me do it. I'm not going to be the timorous guy from Scotland. That's what the difference was. Purely mental state. The day before, I had been a mouse. Now I was a lion.
	
	On 17 July 1993, Obree set a new [[hour record (time trial (cycling))|record]] of 51.596 kilometres, beating Moser's record of 51.151 kilometres by 445 metres.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeme_Obree]

	He is an inspiration. Every time I think about how my gear isn't good enough or I am missing something, I think of this image: https://imgur.com/a/84V9V1q and that reminds me that excuses are worthless, because a guy broke the world record after training on the shittiest setup imaginable and just being very clever and tough as nails.

3. It was [[Chris Boardman]] that loaned Obree his helmet for the world championship final. Boardman was knocked out I recall by Obree. Obree was to face Emenault as I recall in the final. Boardman reckoned his custom helmet was better than Obree's so loaned it to him. He later said that at least he had something in the final. Obree won. You can see the helmet in use on a youtube video.^[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7YBxtiuyNs]
