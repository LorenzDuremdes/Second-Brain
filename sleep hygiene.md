# [[physical exercise]]
1. how long before bedtime shouldn't you do strenuous physical activity?
	1. 1. Overall, the studies reviewed here do not support the hypothesis that evening exercise negatively affects [[sleep]], in fact rather the opposite. **However, [[sleep onset latency|sleep-onset latency]], [[total sleep time|total sleep time]], and [[sleep efficiency|SE]] might be impaired after vigorous exercise ending ≤ 1 h before bedtime**.^[[Effects of Evening Exercise on Sleep in Healthy Participants: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30374942/)]
	2. Overall, regardless of intensity, acute evening exercise completed before bedtime does not disrupt subsequent sleep in healthy young and middle-aged adults.
	   
	   Compared to no exercise, acute evening moderate-intensity exercise was ranked as the most potential method to improve sleep, displaying a trend to improve [[wake after sleep onset|wake time after sleep onset]] (MD = -2.50 min, 95% CI = -8.17 to 1.62), [[sleep efficiency]] (MD = +0.41%, 95% CI = -0.71 to 1.66), the proportion of [[NREM sleep|stage N1]] (MD = -0.72%, 95% CI = -2.08 to 0.71) and N3 sleep ([[slow-wave sleep]]) (MD = +0.84%, 95% CI = -1.17 to 2.78). Acute evening low-intensity exercise displayed the greatest tendency to shorten sleep onset latency (MD = -1.02 min, 95% CI = -4.39 to 2.50) compared to no exercise.^[[Different Intensities of Evening Exercise on Sleep in Healthy Adults: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36540196/)]
	1. Healthy young males can engage in a single bout of moderate-intensity [[aerobic exercise]] or moderate-intensity resistance exercise ceasing 90 min before bed without compromising their subsequent sleep.^[[Moderate-intensity exercise performed in the evening does not impair sleep in healthy males - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31072217/)]
