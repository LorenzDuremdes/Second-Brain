1. facultative [[thermogenesis]]; the increase in [[metabolism|energy expenditure]] in response to cold or diet^[[Implications of nonshivering thermogenesis for energy balance regulation in humans (physiology.org)](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpregu.00652.2010)]
2. The sympathetic control of facultative [[thermogenesis]] is mediated by three b-adrenoceptors [b-adrenoceptors (ARs)], and not by a-adrenoceptors.^[Brown adipose tissue and the regulation of nonshivering thermogenesis, p. 5]
	1. Noradrenaline signals via [[protein kinase]] A (PKA; cAMP-dependent [[protein kinase]]) to increase [[thermogenesis]].
	2. In humans, Zingaretti et al. [15] showed that [[human]] brown adipocytes are innervated by the SNS, and Virtanen et al. [8] demonstrated the presence of the [[beta-3 adrenergic receptor|b3-adrenergic receptor]] (b3-AR) mRNA in these cells.
	3. In nuclear medicine, blocking the b1-AR and b2-AR through administration of propranolol is used to decrease 18F-FDG uptake in BAT in patients at room [[temperature]] [29].
