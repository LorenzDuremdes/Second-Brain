1. [[sleep]]-inducing neurons are found in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) in the hypothalamic area
   
   these neurons secrete inhibitory [[γ-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA) and inhibitory neuropeptide [[galanin]] to produce drowsiness^[[[PDF] Autonomic Dysfunction in Sleep Disorders: From Neurobiological Basis to Potential Therapeutic Approaches | Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/reader/f9d6a046ba7f1c5800768b8e4a0453774c18246f)]^[[[PDF] Monoamines and nitric oxide are employed by afferents engaged in midline thalamic regulation | Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Monoamines-and-nitric-oxide-are-employed-by-engaged-Otake-Ruggiero/10fbf6e57b56ffb4d065f312adb80627f398548d)]
