# Outlander Pro
1. The difference between the Outlander 2 and Outlander PRO is that the Outlander PRO is a lighter backpack made for the most intense and weight sensitive racers. The harness is super thin and breathable. The only downside to the Outlander PRO being so light is that we've had to remove the shoulder adjust ability settings. The pack is also white which attracts less [[heat]].

	The Outlander PRO was created in collaboration with the Cannondale Factory Racing team for Cape Epic 2020.^[https://www.mtbr.com/posts/16390070/]
