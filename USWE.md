# Outlander Pro
1. The difference between the Outlander 2 and Outlander PRO is that the Outlander PRO is a lighter backpack made for the most intense and weight sensitive racers. The harness is super thin and breathable. The only downside to the Outlander PRO being so light is that we've had to remove the shoulder adjust ability settings. The pack is also white which attracts less [[heat]].

	The Outlander PRO was created in collaboration with the Cannondale Factory Racing team for Cape Epic 2020.^[https://www.mtbr.com/posts/16390070/]

	The reviews saying that this was too small - is accurate, however, **keep in mind that this particular pack is designed for PRO mountain bikers and other elite endurance athletes**. Small is the idea to minimize weight and maximize movement.

	The pack sits really HIGH on your back, by design allowing you to access cycling jersey pockets the same way you would access them without a pack on.

	The highest praise I can give to a piece of gear is that you don't notice it. It just does it job without getting in the way. That's exactly how I feel about this pack. You can feel it when you first put it on, but within 10 minutes you don't notice it anymore. Comfortable for 10+ hour endurance events.
	
	There's a reason why this pack is usually sold out.
