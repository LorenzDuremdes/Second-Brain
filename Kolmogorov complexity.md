1. Kolmogorov complexity; of an object, such as a piece of text, is the length of a shortest computer program (in a predetermined [[programming language]]) that produces the object as output^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity]
2. K(x) := min{l(p) : U(p) = x}^[Universal Intelligence - A Definition of Machine Intelligence, p. 22]
	1. K = Kolmogorov complexity
	2. p (program) = binary string (e.g. 11101011...)
	3. l(p) = length of this string in bits
	4. U = a prefix universal Turing machine U called the reference machine
