1. Kolmogorov complexity; of an object, such as a piece of text, is the length of a shortest computer program (in a predetermined [[programming language]]) that produces the object as output^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity]
2. K(x) := min{l(p) : U(p) = x}^[Universal Intelligence - A Definition of Machine Intelligence, p. 22]
	1. K = Kolmogorov complexity
	2. p (program) = binary string (e.g. 11101011...)
	3. l(p) = length of this string in bits
	4. U = a prefix universal Turing machine U called the reference machine
	5. ◇min = minimum length
3. the Kolmogorov complexity is invariant, because K is nearly independent of the choice of U^[Universal Intelligence - A Definition of Machine Intelligence, p. 23]
	1. ◇e.g. other universal Turing machines can reasonably simulate the same inputs with at most an additional cost of l(q) (due to e.g. [[simulation]])
4. environmental complexity = K(µi) := K(<i>)^[Universal Intelligence - A Definition of Machine Intelligence, p. 23]
	1. K = Kolmogorov complexity
	2. µ = environment
	3. i = expresses each index as a binary string
