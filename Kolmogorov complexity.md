1. Kolmogorov complexity; of an object, such as a piece of text, is the length of a shortest computer program (in a predetermined [[programming language]]) that produces the object as output^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity]
2. K(x) := min{l(p) : U(p) = x}^[Universal Intelligence - A Definition of Machine Intelligence, p. 22]
	1. K = Kolmogorov complexity
	2. p (program) = binary string (e.g. 11101011...)
	3. l(p) = length of this string in bits
	4. U = a prefix universal [[Turing machine]] U called the reference machine
	5. ◇min = minimum length
3. the Kolmogorov complexity is invariant, because K is nearly independent of the choice of U^[Universal Intelligence - A Definition of Machine Intelligence, p. 23]
	1. ◇e.g. other universal Turing machines can reasonably simulate the same inputs with at most an additional cost of l(q) (due to e.g. [[simulation]])
4. environmental complexity = K(µi) := K(<i>)^[Universal Intelligence - A Definition of Machine Intelligence, p. 23]
	1. K = Kolmogorov complexity
	2. µ = environment
	3. i = expresses each index as a binary string

# utilization
1. how can humans utilize "Kolmgorov complexity" to learn faster?
   
   Here are some ways to utilize Kolmogorov complexity for faster learning^[GPT-4]:
   
   1. Simplify [[information]]: Break down complex concepts into simpler, more digestible parts. When [[information]] is presented in its simplest form, it becomes easier to understand, process, and retain. By reducing redundancy and focusing on the most essential aspects of a concept, you can minimize [[cognitive load]] and improve comprehension.
   2. Use analogies and metaphors: Relate new concepts to familiar ideas or experiences by using analogies and metaphors. This helps to leverage existing [[knowledge]] and simplify the learning process by making abstract ideas more concrete and relatable.
   3. Create mental models: Build mental models to represent complex [[information]] in a more structured and organized way. Mental models help to simplify complex systems and processes by highlighting the most important elements and their relationships, making it easier to understand and remember the [[information]].
   4. Use mnemonics: Develop mnemonic devices to encode complex [[information]] into simpler forms. Mnemonics work by associating new [[information]] with familiar patterns or structures, making it easier to recall later.
   5. Practice active learning: Engage with the material by asking questions, discussing concepts with others, or applying the [[knowledge]] in real-life situations. Active learning helps to reinforce understanding and retention of complex [[information]] by encouraging deeper processing.
   6. Focus on patterns and relationships: Identify patterns and relationships within the [[information]] being learned. Recognizing connections between different pieces of [[information]] can help to simplify the learning process and improve retention.
   7. Leverage spaced repetition: Review material at progressively increasing intervals to improve long-term retention. Spaced repetition helps to solidify [[knowledge]] in [[memory]], allowing for more efficient retrieval and application of complex [[information]].
   8. By applying these strategies, which are informed by the principles of Kolmogorov complexity, learners can optimize their learning process, leading to faster and more efficient acquisition of new [[knowledge]] and skills.

# hypotheses
1. Kolmogorov complexity ↔ [[adaptive replacement cache]]
	1. the lower the former, the higher the latter (usually) and vice versa
2. Kolmogorov complexity → truth
	1. the lower the former, the closer to the truth
		1. e.g. Arabic numerals has a lower Kolmogorov complexity (e.g. requires less bits to represent numbers) than e.g. Roman numerals
