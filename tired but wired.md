The condition you're describing - feeling "tired but wired" where a person has difficulty falling asleep despite being exhausted - is commonly referred to as "hyperarousal" or "physiological hyperarousal." This state is often associated with [[insomnia]] and other sleep disorders.Hyperarousal is characterized by increased physiological and psychological activation, which can manifest as heightened alertness, anxiety, or restlessness even when a person feels physically tired. This condition can create a frustrating cycle where exhaustion and the inability to sleep reinforce each other.Key points about hyperarousal:

1. Physiological aspects: Hyperarousal is associated with increased activity in the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the "fight or flight" response. This can lead to elevated heart rate, increased body [[temperature]], and higher levels of stress hormones like cortisol^[[Sleep difficulties are associated with increased symptoms of psychopathology](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24496489/)]
2. Psychological aspects: People experiencing hyperarousal may have racing thoughts, worry about sleep, or feel mentally alert despite physical fatigue^[[Listen to the story: chronic fatigue syndrome patients do not live in a vacuum](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21212717/)]
3. Impact on sleep: The heightened state of arousal can make it difficult for individuals to transition into sleep, even when they feel exhausted^[[Work-Related Mental Fatigue, Physical Activity and Risk of Insomnia Symptoms: Longitudinal Data from the Norwegian HUNT Study - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31307230/)]
4. Relation to [[insomnia]]: Hyperarousal is considered a key factor in the development and maintenance of chronic [[insomnia]]^[[Work-Related Mental Fatigue, Physical Activity and Risk of Insomnia Symptoms: Longitudinal Data from the Norwegian HUNT Study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31307230/)]
5. Potential causes: Various factors can contribute to hyperarousal, including chronic stress, anxiety, certain medical conditions, and lifestyle factors^[[Listen to the story: chronic fatigue syndrome patients do not live in a vacuum - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21212717/)]^[[Sleep difficulties are associated with increased symptoms of psychopathology - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24496489/)]

While "hyperarousal" is the most accurate clinical term for this condition, it's worth noting that the phrase "tired but wired" is a common colloquial description used by many people experiencing this state. This phrase effectively captures the paradoxical nature of feeling physically exhausted yet mentally alert or restless.Understanding hyperarousal is crucial in addressing sleep disorders, as it often requires a multifaceted approach to treatment that may include stress reduction techniques, cognitive-behavioral therapy for [[insomnia]] (CBT-I), and in some cases, medication to help regulate the sleep-wake cycle.
