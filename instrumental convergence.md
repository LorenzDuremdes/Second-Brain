1. instrumental convergence; the hypothetical tendency for most sufficiently intelligent agents to pursue potentially unbounded instrumental goals provided that their ultimate goals are themselves unlimited
	1. Instrumental convergence posits that an intelligent agent with unbounded but apparently harmless goals can act in surprisingly harmful ways. For example, a computer with the sole, unconstrained [[goal]] of solving an incredibly difficult [[mathematics]] problem like the Riemann hypothesis could attempt to turn the entire Earth into one giant computer in an effort to increase its computational power so that it can succeed in its calculations.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence#cite_note-aama-1]
