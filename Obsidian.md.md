# sort
1. when to create a new Obsidian.md note vs. putting new content under existing one?
	1. put new content under existing note when it causes [[interference theory|interference]] otherwise
		1. e.g. "saddle" (road cycling) → high probability of interference

			vs.
			
			"[[aerobic exercise]]" → lower probability of interference despite being a subcomponent of "exercise" and "aerobic"
2. where to put the following [[information]] in Obsidian.md + why
	1. [[entropy]] ([[information]] theory) → dimension
		5th dimension (usually)
		1. under "[[entropy]] ([[information]] theory)", because you are describing a property of that and it's just one of many examples of the concept "dimension"
			1. the one with higher [[self-determination theory|relatedness]]
			
# search
1. what items should you try to search in Obsidian.md to connect nodes?
	1. concepts you think can easily connect with other concepts
		1. e.g. the word "the" would result in most cases a low yield
			1. "the" → too high-level construal
		2. related to [[bubble sort]]
			1. i.e. comparing everything with everything
2. how to fix numbering in Obsidian.md when e.g. extracting a part somewhere else?
	1. Control + [
3. w:"text" ([[Anki]]) (Obsidian.md equivalent)
	1. "text"^[https://publish.obsidian.md/help/Plugins/Search]

# the Obsidian.md universe/reality
1. ![image](https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Cosmic-void-1.jpg)^[https://www.universetoday.com/135954/largest-scales-milky-way-galaxy-middle-nowhere/]
2. planetoids, meteorites, etc.
	1. the individual letters of each word
3. what could represent "planets" in Obsidian.md?
	1. the individual words of note
4. stars
	1. the individual nodes as seen in "[[Mind]] Map"
5. galaxies
	1. each individual node
6. universe
	1. each individual Obsidian.md Vault
7. multiverse/reality
	1. all Obsidian.md Vaults
8. intelligent life
	1. connections made per galaxy (or e.g. between solar systems → the more connections in "[[Mind]] Map", the more intelligent life *is*)

# connect
1. connections between nodes need to make sense representing your [[brain]] as close as possible
2. the fewer connections you estimate a concept will have in the (near) future, the more likely you should place it under an existing note
	1. [[construal level theory|lower-level construals]] → usually have fewer connections
3. high [[semantic distance|semantic distances]] → [[computational complexity]] (Obsidian.md)
	1. connecting concepts with high semantic distances might increase [[computational complexity]] more e.g. less organization/[[connectivity noise]]
		1. one way to estimate is via "[[adaptive replacement cache]]" (conjunction?)
# capacity
1. how many notes can Obsidian.md handle at a relatively fast speed?
