1. [[human]] working [[human memory]] is analogous to concurrent computing
2. rehearsal vs. maintenance of verbal working-[[memory]] content; left frontal [[cortex]] vs. left posterior parietal [[cortex]] (respectively)
	1. left frontal [[cortex]] → advanced enough for rehearsal
3. age → working-[[memory]] capacity + speed
	1. working-[[memory]] capacity declines faster than [[throughput|processing speed]]
4. $\text{genetics → working memory*correlation}$
	1. ~50% genetically determined

# [[memory]] span
1. why does [[memory]] span decrease after adulthood?
	1. a decrease of working [[memory]] storage and processing speed ([[myelin|demyelination]])
		1. slower processing speed → e.g. [[cache|caching]] issues?
2. why did they invent a separate reading span task beside [[memory]] span?
	1. because there's a weak correlation between [[memory]] span (e.g. digits) and complex cognitive tasks e.g. text comprehension^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_span#cite_note-34]
