1. [[human]] working [[human memory]] is analogous to concurrent computing
2. rehearsal vs. maintenance of verbal working-[[memory]] content; left frontal [[cortex]] vs. left posterior parietal [[cortex]] (respectively)
	1. left frontal [[cortex]] → advanced enough for rehearsal
3. age → working-[[memory]] capacity + speed
	1. working-[[memory]] capacity declines faster than [[throughput|processing speed]]
4. genetics → working [[memory]] · correlation
	1. ~50% genetically determined

# capacity
1. too many clozes (usually ≥5) of the same card (working [[memory]] analogy)
	1. ◇exponential increase in complexity ([[logical conjunction|conjunction]])

# [[memory]] span
1. why does [[memory]] span decrease after adulthood?
	1. a decrease of working [[memory]] storage and processing speed ([[myelin|demyelination]])
		1. slower processing speed → e.g. [[cache|caching]] issues?
2. why did they invent a separate reading span task beside [[memory]] span?
	1. because there's a weak correlation between [[memory]] span (e.g. digits) and complex cognitive tasks e.g. text comprehension^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_span#cite_note-34]
		1. **related**: [[hardware and software]]

# [[developmental neuroscience]]
1. the capacity of working memory increases gradually over childhood
	1. why? ◇e.g. more efficient sensory gating
