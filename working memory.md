1. [[human]] working [[memory]] is analogous to concurrent computing
2. rehearsal vs. maintenance of verbal working-memory content; left frontal [[cortex]] vs. left posterior parietal [[cortex]] (respectively)
	1. left frontal [[cortex]] → advanced enough for rehearsal
3. age → working-memory capacity + speed
	1. working-memory capacity declines faster than [[throughput|processing speed]]
4. $\text{genetics → working memory*correlation}$
	1. ~50% genetically determined

# memory span
1. why does memory span decrease after adulthood?
	1. a decrease of working memory storage and processing speed ([[myelin|demyelination]])
		1. slower processing speed → e.g. [[cache|caching]] issues?
