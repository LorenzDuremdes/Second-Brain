	1. All of the nutrition and hydration choices you make in the 18–48-hour period between your workouts determine whether you have the [[carbohydrate]] stores necessary for a high-quality training session. In contrast, your immediate pre-workout nutrition choices don’t do much to change your [[glycogen]] stores; they have more impact on how energized you feel.^[The [[Time]]-Crunched Cyclist: Race-Winning Fitness in 6 Hours a Week, 3rd Edition, p. 22]

## anecdotes
1. The amount of times I have come home completely destroyed because I didn’t understand the importance of eating more than a couple hundred calories is astounding. I ripped 4 hrs on Sunday. First 4 hr ride of the year properly fueled for the entire thing got home and then did shit around the house, played with the dog, washed my bike, etc. In the past I would have been splayed out on the couch basically useless. Figuring out fueling has completely changed my weekends. Also for those of you not mixing your own fuel it’s easy AF. Buy a scale and buy bulk malt and fructose flavor as desired.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/1ah1df4/comment/kol0746/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
