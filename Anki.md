# Anki [[hardware and software]]
1. what could cause high CPU usage in Anki?
	1. hardware acceleration is off (by default)

# reviews
1. Anki flags → [[Levels of Processing model]]
	1. Anki flags might increase the [[Levels of Processing model|levels-of-processing effect]]
2. what could be more effective than reading the whole note? (Anki)
	1. trying to recall the whole note
3. age → accuracy of answer on a cloze + why
	1. the less you used a cloze elsewhere*the older the cloze/note, the less accurate you need to answer it due to high [[opportunity cost]]
		1. high [[opportunity cost]] → would be more efficient to spend your [[time]] and energy on clozes you are more likely to use (in the future)
		2. age → determines "confidence interval" alongside "frequency"

# adding notes
1. how could it be a *good* phenomenon to add something to Anki that's "obvious"?
	1. probably higher intervals
	2. could aid to the proof that you already know the elements well required for understanding it
2. how could it be a *bad* thing to add something to Anki that's "obvious"?
	1. (too many) obvious things that you already use well (subconsciously) → diminishing returns
	2. e.g. it would be like reading a book you already read
4. X → Y
	1. "'Y' makes use of 'X'"
		1. ≤4th dimension
	2. **related**: [[Obsidian.md]]
5. how to fix the last line (bring it back)? (Anki)
	1. And did not she herself revile me there?
		*not to be confused with: revel*
		1. toggle [[network topology|(un)ordered]] list
1. elements possibly contributing to an optimal item:
	1. compressing an item where "differential quantity - differential quality = 0" (local/global maximum)
	2. representing one chunk in your [[human brain|brain]]
	3. sufficiently long [[half-life]] (e.g. hundreds of years isn't necessary)
	4. low enough [[interference theory|interference]]
	5. note:card ratio=1

## data compression
1. comparison (SRS compression)
	1. comparisons between items can reduce the quantity of notes e.g. the following compresses it to 50%:

		A; B + C; D

		→ "A ↮ C

		B ↮ D (respectively)"

## cloze ([[knowledge]] formulation)
1. what [[algorithm]] can you use to determine what to cloze? (Anki)
	1. [[adaptive replacement cache]] → whatever you cloze, you bring to a higher [[cache]] hierachy
2. which of the following notes could be more effective + why (Anki)

	static [[IQ]] test; they test an individual’s [[knowledge]] and ability to solve one-off problems they do not directly measure the ability to learn and adapt over [[time]]^[Universal [[Intelligence]]: A [[Definition]] of Machine [[Intelligence]], p. 9]

	↮

	static ↮ dynamic [[IQ]] test

	?
	1. the latter, because you question both of them (rather than just one)
		1. you can't necessarily expect you will automatically recall the antonym (dynamic in the former), ◇although it may happen subconsciously
1. should you cloze e.g. "increases" in the following? + why
	1. [[social learning theory]] → [[social currency]]


		social learning increases social currency (usually)
		1. no, because it's redundant (you already stored it by expanding the content of "social learning theory → social currency")
			1. **related**: [[interference theory]]
1. why did you decide to only cloze 1 component + what
	1. mathematical model; a description of a system using mathematical concepts and [[language]]
		1. only clozed the latter → I will rarely use the term "mathematical model", but it's description might make me remind of this concept
			1. clozing the latter has a larger "area of effect"
# stats
1. how to view how many past reviews you did in e.g. a month?
	2. ![[Anki Reviews.png]]
		1. searching for "rated:30" in "Browse" gives a lower number (less accurate?)
2. how much faster than top 1% students/intelligent people do you learn according to the following?
	1. ![[Anki Browse.png]]
	3. ![[Anki Time Spent Creating Cards.jpg]]
	4. ![[Anki Reviews.png]]
		1. top students = 6 items per day*30 days in 160 hours ≈ 1 lifetime item per hour
		2. you = 826 items in 30 days in 30.42 hours ≈ 28 lifetime items per hour
# browse
1. how to search for a note ID (Anki)?
	1. nid:*n*
2. how to search for the specific phrase e.g. "dog" (and not e.g. "doggy"?) (Anki)
	1. Browse → w:dog
