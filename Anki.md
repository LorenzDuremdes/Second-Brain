# Anki software
1. what could cause high CPU usage in Anki?
	1. hardware acceleration is off (by default)

# reviews
1. Anki flags → [[Levels of Processing model]]
	1. Anki flags might increase the [[Levels of Processing model|levels-of-processing effect]]
2. what could be more effective than reading the whole note? (Anki)
	1. trying to recall the whole note
3. age → accuracy of answer on a cloze + why
	1. the less you used a cloze elsewhere*the older the cloze/note, the less accurate you need to answer it due to high [[opportunity cost]]
		1. high opportunity cost → would be more efficient to spend your time and energy on clozes you are more likely to use (in the future)
		2. age → determines "confidence interval" alongside "frequency"

# adding notes
1. how could it be a good phenomenon to add something to Anki that's "obvious"?
	1. probably higher intervals
	2. could aid to the proof that you already know the elements well required for understanding it
2. how could it be a bad thing to add something to Anki that's "obvious"?
	1. (too many) obvious things that you already use well (subconsciously) → diminishing returns
	2. e.g. it would be like reading a book you already read
4. X → Y
	1. "'Y' makes use of 'X'"
		1. ≤4th dimension
	2. **related**: [[Obsidian.md]]
5. how to fix the last line (bring it back)? (Anki)
	1. And did not she herself revile me there?
		*not to be confused with: revel*
		1. toggle [[network topology|(un)ordered]] list
1. elements possibly contributing to an optimal item:
	1. compressing an item where "differential quantity - differential quality = 0" (local/global maximum)
	2. representing one chunk in your [[human brain|brain]]
	3. sufficiently long [[half-life]] (e.g. hundreds of years isn't necessary)
	4. low enough [[interference theory|interference]]
	5. note:card ratio=1
## cloze
1. should you cloze e.g. "increases" in the following? + why
	1. [[social learning theory]] → [[social currency]]


		social learning increases social currency (usually)
		1. no, because it's redundant (you already stored it by expanding the content of "social learning theory → social currency")
			1. **related**: [[interference theory]]
1. why did you decide to only cloze 1 component + what
	1. mathematical model; a description of a system using mathematical concepts and language
		1. only clozed the latter → I will rarely use the term "mathematical model", but it's description might make me remind of this concept
			1. clozing the latter has a larger "area of effect"
# stats
1. how to view how many past reviews you did in e.g. a month?
	2. ![[Anki Reviews.png]]
		1. searching for "rated:30" in "Browse" gives a lower number (less accurate?)
2. how much faster than top 1% students/intelligent people do you learn according to the following?
	1. ![[Anki Browse.png]]
	3. ![[Anki Time Spent Creating Cards.jpg]]
	4. ![[Anki Reviews.png]]
		1. top students = 6 items per day*30 days in 160 hours ≈ 1 lifetime item per hour
		2. you = 826 items in 30 days in 30.42 hours ≈ 28 lifetime items per hour
# browse
1. how to search for a note ID (Anki)?
	1. nid:*n*
2. how to search for the specific phrase e.g. "dog" (and not e.g. "doggy"?) (Anki)
	1. Browse → w:dog
