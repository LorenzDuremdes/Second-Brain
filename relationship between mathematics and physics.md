1. relationship between [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]; clearly delineate [[mathematics]] and physics: For some results or discoveries, it is difficult to say to which area they belong: to the [[mathematics]] or to physics.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_between_mathematics_and_physics#cite_note-20]
2. [[Mathematics]] was developed by the Ancient Civilizations for intellectual challenge and pleasure. Surprisingly, many of their discoveries later played prominent roles in physical theories, as in the case of the conic sections in celestial mechanics.^[By Magister_Mathematicae - Own work based on: Secciones cónicas.svg, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=18556148]
