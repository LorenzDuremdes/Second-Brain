# [[pharmacokinetics]]
1. GW501516 → post-exercise adaptations
	1. it mediates oxidative adaption following exercise training and increased expression in [[skeletal muscle]] was reported after both acute exercise and [[endurance training]]^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4421799/]
2. does GW501516 increase [[mitochondrial biogenesis]]?
	1. molecular analyses revealed that PPARδ is involved in exercise-induced reprogramming of muscle fibres and [[skeletal muscle]] metabolism by regulating expression of genes associated with contractile proteins, [[mitochondrial biogenesis]], and [[lipid metabolism|lipid oxidation]]
	   
	   qPCR analysis revealed that GW501516 treatment alone or in combination with training upregulated expression of [[PPARGC1A|PPARγ coactivator 1α (PGC1α)]] and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4)^[[A metabolomic study of the PPARδ agonist GW501516 for enhancing running endurance in Kunming mice - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4421799/)]

1. GW501516 → [[lactate]]
	1. GW501516 also increased [[blood sugar level|blood glucose]] and lowered [[blood]] [[lactate]] compared to control mice, particularly after running tests and in trained mice^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4421799/]

	   Forced wheel running endurance tests were performed following 3 weeks of treatment. (**a**) shows the total distance ran by mice in each group.

1. GW501516 → exercise-induced damage
	1. Long-distance running involves mobilization of BCAA29 and many studies demonstrate that BCAA concentrations immediately after exercise are reduced in the serum, but not in muscle30. We found that training or GW501516 treatment, preserved serum BCAA levels after exhaustive running. As essential amino acids, BCAA are primarily metabolized in muscle and are important for [[protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]], [[neurotransmitter]] synthesis, and repair of exercise-induced [[skeletal muscle]] damage31,32. Increased BCAA may both act as an [[energy]] source (Supplementary Fig. S3 online) and protect [[mitochondria]] from [[peripheral fatigue|exercise-induced damage]] to preserve mitochondrial function.^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4421799/]

# [[pharmacodynamics]]
1. does having higher fitness lead to diminishing returns using GW501516?
	1. The study does highlight different metabolic pathways influenced by training versus GW501516 treatment. Training increases [[energy]] availability through [[protein catabolism]] and [[gluconeogenesis]], whereas GW501516 primarily enhances [[lipid metabolism|fatty acid oxidation]] and reduces [[glucose]] utilization. This suggests that GW501516 offers a distinct advantage in endurance enhancement, working synergistically with the effects of training to further improve performance.
	   
	   **Therefore, while trained mice already have enhanced endurance from exercise, GW501516 still significantly boosts their performance, suggesting additive or synergistic effects rather than diminishing returns. The substantial improvements in both groups underline GW501516's potent effect on endurance, regardless of the baseline fitness level conferred by prior training**.^[[A metabolomic study of the PPARδ agonist GW501516 for enhancing running endurance in Kunming mice - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4421799/), GPT-4]
2. does solely taking GW501516 enhance endurance?
	1. even GW501516 treatment alone (NG group) for only 1 week improved the running distance by 671.8 m (48.6%) compared to the vehicle control group (NN group) (Supplementary Fig. S1a online)^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4421799/]
3. GW501516 → insulin^[https://www.reddit.com/r/cardarine/comments/ggtamn/cardarine_benifits_from_clinical_trials/]^[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0300908404002354?via=ihub]
	1. the former can reduce insulin resistance (and possibly e.g. type 2 diabetes)
2. fast- vs. slow-twitch dominant · GW501516
	1. being fast-twitch dominant in conjunction with GW501516 might have a higher potential (e.g. larger muscle fibers to be converted to type 2a)?
	2. **GW501516 increases the quantity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-positive muscle fibres in both sedentary and trained mice**
	   
	   SDH staining of gastrocnemius muscle sections revealed that there was a statistically insignificant trend for the proportion of SDH-positive fibres to increase following training alone compared to sedentary mice (TN versus NN) (Fig. 8). In contrast, GW501516 alone significantly increased the proportion of SDH-positive fibres by 72% compared to untreated sedentary mice (NG versus NN). Trained mice that were treated with GW501516 had 113% more SDH-positive fibres than untrained sedentary mice (TG versus NN) (Fig. 8b). Moreover the increase in SDH-positive fibres in trained mice treated with GW501516 occurred in a time dependent manner. Compared to the NN group, TG mice had 36% more fibres after 1 week and 82% after 2 weeks (Supplementary Fig. S2 online).
