1. current most dangerous side-effect
	1. it entered into clinical development as a [[drug]] candidate for metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, but was abandoned in 2007 because animal testing showed that the [[drug]] caused cancer to develop rapidly in several organs.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW501516#cite_note-Sahebkar2014rev-2]

# [[pharmacokinetics]]
1. GW501516 → post-exercise adaptations
	1. it mediates oxidative adaption following exercise training and increased expression in [[skeletal muscle]] was reported after both acute exercise and [[endurance training]]^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4421799/]
2. GW501516 → [[lactate]]
	1. GW501516 also increased [[blood sugar level|blood glucose]] and lowered [[blood]] [[lactate]] compared to control mice, particularly after running tests and in trained mice^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4421799/]
2. GW501516 → exercise-induced damage
	1. Long-distance running involves mobilization of BCAA29 and many studies demonstrate that BCAA concentrations immediately after exercise are reduced in the serum, but not in muscle30. We found that training or GW501516 treatment, preserved serum BCAA levels after exhaustive running. As essential amino acids, BCAA are primarily metabolized in muscle and are important for [[protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]], [[neurotransmitter]] synthesis, and repair of exercise-induced [[skeletal muscle]] damage31,32. Increased BCAA may both act as an [[energy]] source (Supplementary Fig. S3 online) and protect [[mitochondria]] from [[peripheral fatigue|exercise-induced damage]] to preserve mitochondrial function.^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4421799/]

# [[pharmacodynamics]]
1. GW501516 → insulin^[https://www.reddit.com/r/cardarine/comments/ggtamn/cardarine_benifits_from_clinical_trials/]^[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0300908404002354?via=ihub]
	1. the former can reduce insulin resistance (and possibly e.g. type 2 diabetes)

1. do you tend to keep the GW501516 gains?^[https://www.reddit.com/r/sarmssourcetalk/comments/kimaen/keep_endurance_gains_after_cardarine_cycle/]^[https://www.reddit.com/r/sarmssourcetalk/comments/f3k7ry/has_anyone_kept_any_endurance_gains_from_cardarine/][https://www.reddit.com/r/cardarine/comments/n527kf/cardarine_endurance/]^[https://www.reddit.com/r/sarmssourcetalk/comments/nhjk0u/comment/gyyghiv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
	1. depends on periodization (e.g. if you continue at the same load, you probably will) and probably things like nutrition as well
	2. ◇things like recovery at the same relative intensity might be lower

# self
## ~January 2022
1. you easily outpaced friends
2. you outpaced ... as well (you were in Superman position while he was on a semi-speed bike, upright position, although he did draft first couple minutes behind you) while recovering much faster than him
3. 5 PRs despite only being ~85% recovered (1 day rest → Sunday)
4. fatigue barely went up next day despite an effort that would kill you the previous day as a natural (you can feel the recovery on an hourly basis rather than days)
5. motivation doesn't seem to lower as fast/much despite being very fatigued at the end of the first microcycle

## 2 September 2022
1. achieved a PR at F35 (Enschede > Hengelo) without much effort (~upper Z3) and not fully physically recovered
2. sRPE went down by a lot compared to distance/load
3. no longer feeling any fatigue at lower intensities (usually was the case after accumulating fatigue and cycling for a few minutes)
