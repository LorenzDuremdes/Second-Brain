# [[pharmacokinetics]]
1. GW501516 → post-exercise adaptations
	1. it mediates oxidative adaption following exercise training and increased expression in [[skeletal muscle]] was reported after both acute exercise and [[endurance training]]^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4421799/]
2. does GW501516 increase [[mitochondrial biogenesis]]?
	1. molecular analyses revealed that PPARδ is involved in exercise-induced reprogramming of muscle fibres and [[skeletal muscle]] [[metabolism]] by regulating expression of genes associated with contractile proteins, [[mitochondrial biogenesis]], and [[lipid metabolism|lipid oxidation]]
	   
	   qPCR analysis revealed that GW501516 treatment alone or in combination with training upregulated expression of [[PPARGC1A|PPARγ coactivator 1α (PGC1α)]] and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4)^[[A metabolomic study of the PPARδ agonist GW501516 for enhancing running endurance in Kunming mice - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4421799/)]

1. GW501516 → exercise-induced damage
	1. Long-distance running involves mobilization of BCAA29 and many studies demonstrate that BCAA concentrations immediately after exercise are reduced in the serum, but not in muscle30. We found that training or GW501516 treatment, preserved serum BCAA levels after exhaustive running. As essential amino acids, BCAA are primarily metabolized in muscle and are important for [[protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]], [[neurotransmitter]] synthesis, and repair of exercise-induced [[skeletal muscle]] damage31,32. Increased BCAA may both act as an [[energy]] source (Supplementary Fig. S3 online) and protect [[mitochondria]] from [[peripheral fatigue|exercise-induced damage]] to preserve mitochondrial function.^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4421799/]
2. GW501516 → respiratory exchange ratio
	1. decreased utilization of carbohydrates as [[energy]] and a proportional increase in [[lipid metabolism|fat oxidation]] were presumed to be the central mechanism for PPARδ-enhanced physical endurance and this was confirmed by observing a reduced respiratory exchange ratio in GW501516-treated animals^[[A metabolomic study of the PPARδ agonist GW501516 for enhancing running endurance in Kunming mice - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4421799/)]

# [[pharmacodynamics]]
1. does having higher fitness lead to diminishing returns using GW501516?
	1. The study does highlight different metabolic pathways influenced by training versus GW501516 treatment. Training increases [[energy]] availability through [[protein catabolism]] and [[gluconeogenesis]], whereas GW501516 primarily enhances [[lipid metabolism|fatty acid oxidation]] and reduces [[glucose]] utilization. This suggests that GW501516 offers a distinct advantage in endurance enhancement, working synergistically with the effects of training to further improve performance.
	   
	   **Therefore, while trained mice already have enhanced endurance from exercise, GW501516 still significantly boosts their performance, suggesting additive or synergistic effects rather than diminishing returns. The substantial improvements in both groups underline GW501516's potent effect on endurance, regardless of the baseline fitness level conferred by prior training**.^[[A metabolomic study of the PPARδ agonist GW501516 for enhancing running endurance in Kunming mice - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4421799/), GPT-4]
2. does solely taking GW501516 enhance endurance?
	1. even GW501516 treatment alone (NG group) for only 1 week improved the running distance by 671.8 m (48.6%) compared to the vehicle control group (NN group) (Supplementary Fig. S1a online)^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4421799/]
3. GW501516 → [[insulin]]^[https://www.reddit.com/r/cardarine/comments/ggtamn/cardarine_benifits_from_clinical_trials/]^[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0300908404002354?via=ihub]
	1. the former can reduce [[insulin]] resistance (and possibly e.g. type 2 diabetes)
2. fast- vs. slow-twitch dominant · GW501516
	1. being fast-twitch dominant in conjunction with GW501516 might have a higher potential (e.g. larger muscle fibers to be converted to type 2a)?
	2. **GW501516 increases the quantity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-positive muscle fibres in both sedentary and trained mice**
	   
	   SDH staining of gastrocnemius muscle sections revealed that there was a statistically insignificant trend for the proportion of SDH-positive fibres to increase following training alone compared to sedentary mice (TN versus NN) (Fig. 8). In contrast, GW501516 alone significantly increased the proportion of SDH-positive fibres by 72% compared to untreated sedentary mice (NG versus NN). Trained mice that were treated with GW501516 had 113% more SDH-positive fibres than untrained sedentary mice (TG versus NN) (Fig. 8b). Moreover the increase in SDH-positive fibres in trained mice treated with GW501516 occurred in a time dependent manner. Compared to the NN group, TG mice had 36% more fibres after 1 week and 82% after 2 weeks (Supplementary Fig. S2 online).

	   (**a**) shows representative cross sections of a metachromatically stained gastrocnemius from each group of mice. Type-I fibres are stained blue.

1. I have wrote about this on a previous account, before I deleted it.
   
   But, I ran competitive cross country and track in college. I went to nationals my Junior year and Senior year in track and competed every year at nationals in cross country.
   
   I broke my leg at the end of my junior year and missed an entire summer of training.
   
   I got back in to slow long miles towards the end of cross country but nothing serious.
   
   I had a time trail before I got on GW at 2:02 for an 800. My first indoor meet I was on GW for 14 days to help get back in shape and ran 1:54 for my first meet.
   
   That was two weeks that got me back into shape.
   
   The cardio gains happen overnight. My workouts got significantly easier and I always felt like I had another gear left.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/92m5u3/comment/e36q59t/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]
   
   My biggest change was 4:11 to 4:06 for the indoor mile
   
   Yeah man, the closer you get to a 4 minute mile the harder. Up until 1960’s not a single human had ever ran faster than a 4 minute mile.
   
   I had pretty much ran every day since middle school. College id run 8-10 miles in the morning and do my workout at night. I got to 4:20’s and thought I would never get faster.
2. Notably I barely sweat. Where usually I'm sweating A LOT. Additionally I'm usually completely done after I come off the treadmill and ready to go home and crash / pass out. However after I came off the treadmill I felt completely normal and like I could go and do the same thing again.
   
   This session kind of made me come to a realisation though. Probably a side effect that isn't really talked about with cardarine. And that's my body's inability to provide accurate feedback to me if I should stop or that I'm too tired.
   
   One of the biggest benefits I've noticed so far is the feeling of not even feeling like you've worked out. Like you could just go and do it all again after you finish your workout.^[[The most comprehensive Cardarine (GW501516) write up on the internet. : r/cardarine (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardarine/comments/k7f3jh/the_most_comprehensive_cardarine_gw501516_write/)]
1. Okay so I actually ran this while I was running track in college.
   
   I started using it to come back from an injury. It kicked in within the first 3 days. We had a 10x200 meter track workout. 27-29 seconds for our 200s with 30 second break.
   
   I ended up doing 14 200's at 27. It was unreal.
