# [[endurance training]]
1. does [[endurance training]] increase anabolism e.g. [[skeletal muscle]] [[protein]] synthesis?
	1. From this systematic review, eight (of nine) and seven (of seven) studies demonstrated significant post-exercise increases in either mixed MPS or at least one pool of muscle proteins analysed in Models 1 (no [[protein]] ingestion) and 2 (peri-exercise [[protein]] ingestion but no placebo comparison), respectively. Compared with a non-[[protein]] placebo, only seven (of 14) studies in Model 3 showed [[protein]] ingestion induced significantly greater MPS responses in mixed MPS or at least one of the muscle [[protein]] pools measured.
	   
	   The majority of studies collectively demonstrated aerobic-based exercise and HIIT, both with and without [[protein]] intake, significantly increased mixed and myofibrillar [[protein]] synthesis post-exercise which intuitively facilitate general [[muscle tissue]] remodelling processes. In contrast, and somewhat paradoxically, there was only limited evidence of increases in [[mitochondria|mitochondrial]] [[protein]] synthesis post-exercise or with [[protein]] ingestion.^[[Muscle Protein Synthesis Responses Following Aerobic-Based Exercise or High-Intensity Interval Training with or Without Protein Ingestion: A Systematic Review | Sports Medicine (springer.com)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-022-01707-x)]
	2. resistance (RE) and endurance (EE) exercise stimulate mixed [[skeletal muscle]] [[protein]] synthesis.^[[Differential effects of resistance and endurance exercise in the fed state on signalling molecule phosphorylation and protein synthesis in human muscle - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2538832/)]
