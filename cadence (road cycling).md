1. optimal cadence (personal hypothesis + preference)
	1. as low as possible while utilizing your slow-twitch muscle fibers as much as possible

		e.g. going downhill at 120+ RPM and spending more [[energy]] lifting your legs up each time rather than moving the bike forward is (personally) inefficient
1. cadence (strength training analogy ([[road cycling]]))
	1. e.g. 15 kg bicep curls only 15 reps, but 7.5 kg able to do 50 (rather than 30)
	2. **see also**: The Time-Crunched Cyclist: Race-Winning Fitness in 6 Hours a Week, 3rd Edition, p. 11
2. how could higher cadence make you recover more quickly ([[road cycling]] ([[physiology]]))?
	1. ◇slow-twitch muscle fibers recover more quickly despite it being perhaps less energetically efficient (e.g. having to lift up your legs more often)

# low ↮ high cadence
1. at what zone is it mostly important to ask whether to do a low ↮ high cadence workout? + why
	1. probably ≤Z3, because at higher intensities, you can't complete intervals at a too low cadence^[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYztMEuoeVg, TrainerRoad]
2. how would 100 watts at higher torque (lower cadence) ↮ lower torque affect fitness gains?
	1. prolonged high-force intervals at an aerobic cardiovascular intensity may also lead a subset of fast-twitch (Type II) muscle fibers to change their characteristics and behave more like endurance-friendly slow-twitch (Type I) fibers^[https://trainright.com/climb-faster-workout-cycling/]
		1. e.g. produce more power with more fatigue resistance (e.g. useful in climbing)
3. when might it be better to train at a particular zone at higher ↮ lower cadences?
	1. depends on the bottleneck e.g. if you need more [[muscular endurance]] it^[https://trainright.com/climb-faster-workout-cycling/]might be better to train at lower cadences
		1. ◇5-hour Z2 at 60 RPM would allow you to hold higher power at a higher cadence, but e.g. promote recovery less (the latter which slower-twitch muscle fibers are more 'specialized' at)
