1. optimal cadence (personal hypothesis + preference)
	1. as low as possible while utilizing your slow-twitch muscle fibers as much as possible

		e.g. going downhill at 120+ RPM and spending more [[energy]] lifting your legs up each time rather than moving the bike forward is (personally) inefficient
1. cadence (strength training analogy ([[road cycling]]))
	1. e.g. 15 kg bicep curls only 15 reps, but 7.5 kg able to do 50 (rather than 30)
	2. **see also**: The Time-Crunched Cyclist: Race-Winning Fitness in 6 Hours a Week, 3rd Edition, p. 11
2. how could higher cadence make you recover more quickly ([[road cycling]] ([[physiology]]))?
	1. â—‡slow-twitch muscle fibers recover more quickly despite it being perhaps less energetically efficient (e.g. having to lift up your legs more often)
