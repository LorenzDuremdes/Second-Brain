1. repetition suppression → [[Levels of Processing model]]
	1. repetition suppression might reduce levels-of-processing effect
		1. contradiction? → there exists a negative correlation between [[IQ]] and neural activity (i.e. during learning tasks) → compensation for better "hardware"?
2. repetition suppression → [[e-learning (theory)]]
	1. repetition suppression might lower all the components
		1. allowing more neural resources for [[germane cognitive load]] despite also lowering it per unit?
