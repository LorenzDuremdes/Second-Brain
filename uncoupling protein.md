1. uncoupling [[protein]]; play a role in normal [[physiology]], as in cold exposure or hibernation, because the [[energy]] is used to generate heat (see [[thermogenesis]]) instead of producing [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]
   
   uncoupling proteins are increased by [[thyroid hormones|thyroid hormone]], [[norepinephrine]], [[epinephrine]], and [[leptin]].
   
   a [[mitochondria|mitochondrial]] inner [[membrane]] [[protein]] that is a regulated [[proton]] channel or transporter. An uncoupling [[protein]] is thus capable of dissipating the [[proton-motive force|proton gradient]] generated by NADH-powered pumping of protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the mitochondrial intermembrane space. The [[energy]] lost in dissipating the [[proton]] gradient via UCPs is not used to do biochemical work. Instead, heat is generated. This is what links UCP to [[thermogenesis]]. However, not every type of UCPs are related to [[thermogenesis]]. Although UCP2 and UCP3 are closely related to UCP1, UCP2 and UCP3 do not affect thermoregulatory abilities of vertebrates.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncoupling_protein]
