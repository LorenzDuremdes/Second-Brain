	1. caffeine increases the level of [[neurotransmitter|norepinephrine]] in your [[human brain|brain]] and can increase e.g. [[anxiety]] ([[stress]])

	1. a meta-analysis identified 21 studies using mostly healthy male subjects (74%) between the ages of 20 and 35 years and showed a 5.6% reduction in RPE during exercise following caffeine ingestion. An average improvement in performance of 11% was reported across all exercise modalities. This meta-analysis established that reductions in RPE explain up to 29% of the variance in the improvement in exercise performance
	2. caffeine has consistently been shown to improve endurance by 2–4% across dozens of studies using doses of 3–6 mg/kg body mass
	3. a recent meta-analysis reporting on 56 endurance time trials in athletes (79% cycling), found the percent difference between the caffeine and placebo group ranged from − 3.0 to 15.9%
	4. this meta-analysis found that caffeine has a small but significant effect on endurance performance when taken in moderate doses (3–6 mg/kg) as well as an overall improvement following caffeine compared to placebo in mean power output of 2.9 ± 2.2% and a small effect size of 0.22 ± 0.15. Time-trial completion time showed improvements of 2.3 ± 2.6% with a small effect size of 0.28 ± 0.12
	5. **sprint** enhancement = caffeine ingestion (6 mg/kg) enhanced mean power output and sprint work by 7 and 8.5%, respectively
	6. caffeine (**[[muscular endurance]]** enhancement) = caffeine was shown to be ergogenic for [[muscular endurance]] in two meta-analyses reporting effect sizes ranging from 0.28 to 0.38 (percent change range: **6 to 7%**)
		1. However, others have shown that it enhances strength but not [[muscular endurance]], and when studies have examined multiple strength-[[muscular endurance]] tasks, there were benefits across the board, none at all, or even impairments in [[muscular endurance]] with caffeine use. **Ingesting caffeine prior to a [[muscular endurance]] task is likely to delay muscular fatigue, but these effects are not consistent among all studies.**
## [[pharmacodynamics]]
1. caffeine (endurance dosage) = 3–6 mg/kg^[[International society of sports nutrition position stand: caffeine and exercise performance | Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition | Full Text (biomedcentral.com)](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-020-00383-4)]
	1. minimal effective doses of caffeine currently remain unclear but they may be as low as 2 mg/kg body mass
	2. the use of caffeine in conjunction with endurance exercise in the heat and at altitude is well supported when dosages range from 3 to 6 mg/kg and 4–6 mg/kg, respectively
2. caffeine (timing) = 1 hour pre-exercise^[[International society of sports nutrition position stand: caffeine and exercise performance | Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition | Full Text (biomedcentral.com)](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-020-00383-4)]
	1. as compared to caffeine capsules, caffeine chewing gums may require a shorter waiting time from consumption to the start of the exercise session
2. caffeine [[half-life]] ≈ 4–6 h
	1. it varies between individuals and even may range from 1.5 to 10 h in adults ^[[International society of sports nutrition position stand: caffeine and exercise performance | Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition | Full Text (biomedcentral.com)](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-020-00383-4#Sec5)]
