	1. caffeine increases the level of [[neurotransmitter|norepinephrine]] in your [[human brain|brain]] and can increase e.g. [[anxiety]] ([[stress]])

1. caffeine (average performance enhancement) = 11%^[[International society of sports nutrition position stand: caffeine and exercise performance | Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition | Full Text (biomedcentral.com)](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-020-00383-4#Sec6)]
	1. a meta-analysis identified 21 studies using mostly healthy male subjects (74%) between the ages of 20 and 35 years and showed a 5.6% reduction in RPE during exercise following caffeine ingestion. An average improvement in performance of 11% was reported across all exercise modalities. This meta-analysis established that reductions in RPE explain up to 29% of the variance in the improvement in exercise performance
	2. caffeine has consistently been shown to improve endurance by 2–4% across dozens of studies using doses of 3–6 mg/kg body mass
	3. a recent meta-analysis reporting on 56 endurance time trials in athletes (79% cycling), found the percent difference between the caffeine and placebo group ranged from − 3.0 to 15.9%
	4. this meta-analysis found that caffeine has a small but significant effect on endurance performance when taken in moderate doses (3–6 mg/kg) as well as an overall improvement following caffeine compared to placebo in mean power output of 2.9 ± 2.2% and a small effect size of 0.22 ± 0.15. Time-trial completion time showed improvements of 2.3 ± 2.6% with a small effect size of 0.28 ± 0.12
	5. **sprint** enhancement = caffeine ingestion (6 mg/kg) enhanced mean power output and sprint work by 7 and 8.5%, respectively
	6. caffeine (**[[muscular endurance]]** enhancement) = caffeine was shown to be ergogenic for [[muscular endurance]] in two meta-analyses reporting effect sizes ranging from 0.28 to 0.38 (percent change range: **6 to 7%**)
		1. However, others have shown that it enhances strength but not [[muscular endurance]], and when studies have examined multiple strength-[[muscular endurance]] tasks, there were benefits across the board, none at all, or even impairments in [[muscular endurance]] with caffeine use. **Ingesting caffeine prior to a [[muscular endurance]] task is likely to delay muscular fatigue, but these effects are not consistent among all studies.**
2. In summary, once the insulation provided by the microclimate and by peripheral [[vasoconstriction]] has been maximized, increasing [[metabolism|metabolic]] heat production (_M_) represents the last line of defence against the cold. This is best illustrated in survival conditions where additional insulation from the environment may not be available. Although several techniques have been used to further enhance _M_ and [[facultative thermogenesis|cold tolerance]], a pharmacological approach has attracted a lot of attention. Indeed, recent experiments in cold-exposed humans have shown that the ingestion of a mixture of [[ephedrine]] and caffeine enhances _M_ and reduces both the heat debt (body heat deficit) and the drop in *T*<sub>re</sub> (P < 0.05).^[[Drug-Induced Delay of Hypothermia - Nutritional Needs In Cold And In High-Altitude Environments - NCBI Bookshelf (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK232875/)]
## [[pharmacodynamics]]
1. caffeine (endurance dosage) = 3–6 mg/kg^[[International society of sports nutrition position stand: caffeine and exercise performance | Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition | Full Text (biomedcentral.com)](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-020-00383-4)]
	1. minimal effective doses of caffeine currently remain unclear but they may be as low as 2 mg/kg body mass
	2. the use of caffeine in conjunction with endurance exercise in the heat and at altitude is well supported when dosages range from 3 to 6 mg/kg and 4–6 mg/kg, respectively
2. caffeine (timing) = 1 hour pre-exercise^[[International society of sports nutrition position stand: caffeine and exercise performance | Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition | Full Text (biomedcentral.com)](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-020-00383-4)]
	1. as compared to caffeine capsules, caffeine chewing gums may require a shorter waiting time from consumption to the start of the exercise session
2. caffeine [[half-life]] ≈ 4–6 h
	1. it varies between individuals and even may range from 1.5 to 10 h in adults ^[[International society of sports nutrition position stand: caffeine and exercise performance | Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition | Full Text (biomedcentral.com)](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-020-00383-4#Sec5)]
