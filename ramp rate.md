1. approximate maximum sustainable average TSS per day = 150^[Dr. Andrew Coggan: https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/endurance-rides-feel-absolutely-useless/89127/135?u=lorenz_duremdes]
	1. For example, the highest continual CTL loads we have seen have been in riders at the [[Tour de France]] who can maintain a CTL between 150 and 160 for most of the year. After the Tour, they have a CTL of 170 to 180. (Ask any rider after the [[Tour de France]] if they would like to do another one and you’ll get a firm “No,” which indicates that a hypothetical genetic limit on CTL could be somewhere between 180 and 200). If they started the Tour at 150 CTL and ended at 170 CTL, their ramp rate would be in the 7 TSS/day range, so even the best riders in the world have a relatively shallow ramp rate when approaching their limit.^[Training and Racing With a Power Meter (Hunter Allen, Andrew R. Coggan), p. 227]
