1. adherens junction; [[protein]] complexes that occur at cell–cell junctions in [[epithelium|epithelial]] and [[endothelium|endothelial]] tissues,^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adherens_junction#cite_note-2] usually more basal than [[tight junction|tight junctions]]
2. Principal interactions of structural proteins at cadherin-based adherens junction. Actin filaments are associated with adherens junctions in addition to several other actin-binding proteins such as vinculin. The head domain of vinculin associates to E-cadherin via α-, β - and γ -catenins. The tail domain of vinculin binds to [[membrane]] lipids and to actin filaments.^[By Mariana Ruiz LadyofHats - i did the diagram myself based on the information found on this websites:[1], [2], ISBN 9514269306/html/x477.html, [3], [4],[5], [6], [7], and [8], Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=756087]
