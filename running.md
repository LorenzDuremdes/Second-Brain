1. [[pelvis]] width → running efficiency
	1. [[Men]] have less [[fat]], [[bone density|denser bones]], more [[oxygen]]-carrying [[red blood cell|red blood cells]], heavier [[skeleton|skeletons]] that can support more [[muscle]], and narrower [[hip|hips]], which makes running more efficient and decreases the chance of injury—like ACL tears, which are epidemic in [[female]] athletes—while running and jumping. “Because they have a broader pelvis, [[women]] have a greater angle to their [[knee]],” says Bruce Latimer, professor of anthropology and anatomy at Case Western Reserve University. “So they waste a lot of [[energy]] that goes into compression in the hip joint and it doesn’t help you move forward. . . . The broader the pelvis, the more wasted energy.”^[The Sports Gene: Inside the Science of Extraordinary Athletic Performance, p. 68]
