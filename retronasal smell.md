1. retronasal smell; creates flavor from smell molecules in foods or drinks shunting up through the nasal passages as one is chewing
   
   When people use the term "[[sense of smell|smell]]", they are usually referring to "orthonasal smell", or the perception of smell molecules that enter directly through the [[nose]] and up the nasal passages.
   
   Retronasal smell is critical for experiencing the [[flavor]] of [[food|foods]] and [[drink|drinks]]. Flavor should be contrasted with [[taste]], which refers to five specific dimensions: (1) [[sweetness|sweet]], (2) [[salt|salty]], (3) [[bitterness|bitter]], (4) [[sourness|sour]], and (5) [[umami]]. Perceiving anything beyond these five dimensions, such as distinguishing the flavor of an apple from a pear for example, requires the sense of retronasal smell.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retronasal_smell]
   
   It may be that the same molecules may be perceived differently when sniffed compared with when they travel from the mouth to the nose. Barry explained: ‘A stinky cheese can smell disgusting orthonsal olfaction – and pretty much like socks. But it can have a delicious flavour when those odours come from the mouth to the nose – retronasal olfaction.’^[Ultra-Processed People The Science Behind the Food That Isnt Food (Chris van Tulleken), p. 170]
