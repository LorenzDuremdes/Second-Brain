Schematic overview of the potential exercise-nutrient-sensitive [[cell signaling|cell signalling pathways]] regulating the enhanced mitochondrial adaptations associated with training with low CHO availability. (1) Reduced muscle [[glycogen]] enhances both AMPK and p38MAPK phosphorylation that results in (2) activation and translocation of PGC-1α and p53 to the [[mitochondria]] and nucleus. (3) Upon entry into the nucleus, PGC-1α co-activates additional transcription factors (i.e. NRF1/2) to increase the expression of COX subunits and Tfam, as well as autoregulating its own expression. In the [[mitochondria]], PGC-1α co-activates Tfam to coordinate regulation of mtDNA, and induces expression of key mitochondrial proteins of the electron transport chain, e.g. COX subunits. Similar to PGC-1α, p53 also translocates to the [[mitochondria]] to modulate Tfam activity and mtDNA expression, and to the nucleus where it functions to increase expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial fission and fusion (DRP-1 and MFN-2) and electron transport chain proteins. (4) Exercising in conditions of reduced CHO availability increases adipose tissue and intramuscular lipolysis via increased circulating [[adrenaline]] concentrations. (5) The resulting elevation in FFA activates the nuclear [[transcription factor]], PPARδ, to increase expression of proteins involved in [[lipid metabolism]], such as CPT1, PDK4, CD36 and HSL. (6) However, consuming pre-exercise meals rich in CHO and/or CHO during exercise can downregulate lipolysis (thereby negating FFA-mediated signalling), as well as reducing both AMPK and p38MAPK activity, thus having negative implications for downstream regulators. (7) High-[[fat]] feeding can also modulate PPARδ signalling and upregulate genes with regulatory roles in [[lipid metabolism]] (and downregulate CHO metabolism), although high-[[fat]] diets may also reduce [[muscle protein synthesis]] via impaired mTOR-p70S6K signalling, despite feeding [[leucine]]-rich [[protein]].^[[Fuel for the Work Required: A Theoretical Framework for Carbohydrate Periodization and the Glycogen Threshold Hypothesis | Sports Medicine (springer.com)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-018-0867-7)]
