*not to be confused with: [[block training]]*

1. block; a block of training is one or more mesocycles which share a specific unified goal. Common examples in [[hypertrophy]] training are muscle gain or [[fat]] loss blocks
	1. e.g. making more use of [[directed adaptation]] (e.g. mesocycles with "body part specialization=chest")

Example of predicted progression of fitness (g), fatigue (h), and performance (p) during 100 days of daily training at a constant (A) or variable (B) average training load of w(t) = 50 followed by 100 days of detraining at w(t) = 0, modelled using equations 14, 15, and 16. Values for the weighting factors k1 and k2 are 1 and 1.5, respectively, and the time constants τ1 and τ2 are 20 days and 7 days, respectively. Units for g, h, and p on the y-axis are arbitrary. Despite an overall identical accumulated training load of 5000 units over the training period, the performance peak in the variable program (B) is greater than that of the constant program (A).^[[The three-dimensional impulse-response model: Modeling the training process in accordance with energy system-specific adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14841)]
