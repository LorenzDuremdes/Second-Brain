1. block; a block of training is one or more mesocycles which share a specific unified goal. Common examples in [[hypertrophy]] training are muscle gain or [[fat]] loss blocks

Example of predicted progression of fitness (g), fatigue (h), and performance (p) during 100 days of daily training at a constant (A) or variable (B) average training load of w(t) = 50 followed by 100 days of detraining at w(t) = 0, modelled using equations 14, 15, and 16. Values for the weighting factors k1 and k2 are 1 and 1.5, respectively, and the time constants τ1 and τ2 are 20 days and 7 days, respectively. Units for g, h, and p on the y-axis are arbitrary. Despite an overall identical accumulated training load of 5000 units over the training period, the performance peak in the variable program (B) is greater than that of the constant program (A).^[[The three-dimensional impulse-response model: Modeling the training process in accordance with energy system-specific adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14841)]
   **ChatGPT 5**
This image is **Figure 6** from the paper, and it’s illustrating how the classic **Banister impulse–response model** predicts changes in **fitness**, **fatigue**, and **performance** depending on whether training load is kept constant or varied over time.

### **Panel A – Constant training load**
- **w(t) constant**: Training load is kept the same every day (horizontal blue-striped bar).
- Fitness (**g**, grey line) rises gradually over ~100 days until it plateaus.
- Fatigue (**h**, light grey line) also rises but on a shorter time constant (τ₂ = 7 days), so it fluctuates less and drops faster after training stops.
- Performance (**p**, black line) = fitness – (1.5 × fatigue).
    - Because both fitness and fatigue rise together, performance stabilizes rather than continually increasing.  
- After training stops at day 100 (w(t) = 0), both fitness and fatigue decay, but fatigue decays faster → performance temporarily bumps up, then declines.

### **Panel B – Variable training load**
- **w(t) variable**: Same _total_ training load over 100 days as Panel A (5000 a.u.) but delivered in spikes and troughs (purple bars).
- Periods of higher load spike both fitness and fatigue, but because fatigue decays faster, the performance peaks are higher when timed right.
- Overall **peak performance** is greater than in the constant-load scenario, even with the same total training done.
- This illustrates why **periodization** and **load variation** can produce better results than steady, unchanging training.

**Key takeaway from the figure**  
The Banister model predicts that:
1. **Performance** is a balance between **fitness gains** (slower to build and lose) and **fatigue** (faster to build and dissipate).
2. Varying training load strategically (rather than keeping it constant) can yield higher performance peaks if timed so that fitness is high and fatigue is low — especially before competition.
