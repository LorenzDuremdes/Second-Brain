1. Conclusions: Elderly people taking anticholinergic drugs were at increased risk for cognitive decline and [[dementia]]. Discontinuing anticholinergic treatment was associated with a decreased risk. Physicians should carefully consider prescription of anticholinergic drugs in elderly people, especially in the very elderly and in persons at high genetic risk for cognitive disorder.^[[Drugs with anticholinergic properties, cognitive decline, and dementia in an elderly general population: the 3-city study - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19636034/)]^[[Cumulative use of strong anticholinergics and incident dementia: a prospective cohort study - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25621434/)]^[[Antihistamine - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihistamine)]
   
   No, it will not increase your risk for [[dementia]]. The most popular study that people are referring to have studied the use of benadryl in a population who are 65 or older. The main purpose of the study was to dissuade providers from prescribing anti-cholinergic (not only benadryl - an antihistamine) to elderly people.^[[Does taking benadryl long term actually increase your risk of dementia/ alzheimers? : r/AskDocs (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/qh1zix/comment/hib9puu/?context=3&share_id=arnHpxdMpUhnQRV0C7Wh7&utm_content=1&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1)]
