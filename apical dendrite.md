1. apical dendrite; a dendrite that emerges from the apex of a pyramidal [[cell]].^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apical_dendrite#cite_note-15th-1]
2. The apical dendrite rises from the apex of the pyramidal [[cell]]'s soma. The apical dendrite is a single, long, thick dendrite that branches several times as distance from the soma increases and extends towards the cortical surface.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramidal_cell#cite_note-Megias-4]
3. A reconstruction of a pyramidal [[cell]]. Soma and dendrites are labeled in red, [[axon]] arbor in blue. (1) Soma, (2) Basal dendrite, (3) Apical dendrite, (4) [[axon]], (5) Collateral [[axon]].

4. dendrites = receptors? + why
	1. no, but dendrites to contain receptors
		1. The surface of the dendrites is filled with receptors that become enacted upon by neurotransmitters that traversed the [[synapse]] after the pre-synaptic neuron fired and released neurotransmitters into the [[synapse]].^[https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/dendrites]
