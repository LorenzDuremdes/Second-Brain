# [[motivation]]
1. [[growth mindset]] vs. 'winning mindset'
	1. This outlook has some fantastic consequences for the mental stability of an athlete. One is that it stops defeat from being too discouraging – I’m guessing, but my suspicion is that the stars from his youth tended to quit when they started to lose. Another is that when you do win, it stops you from being satisfied with that. If you think you can do better, you’ll go right ahead and try to do better. As Dan Hunt put it, ‘**These guys can win Olympic gold, break the world record, do the event to the highest standard that anyone in the history of cycling has ever managed, and still come away thinking about how they can do it better next time.’ Winning is one thing – keeping winning is entirely another**.^[Faster - The Obsession, Science and Luck Behind the World's Fastest Cyclists (by Michael Hutchinson), p. 106]

## personal (prioritized)
1. [[transhumanism]]
	1. their ability to decouple [[emotion]] from behavior (logic-oriented)
	2. [[altercasting]]
2. scarcity / fear of isolation
3. internal locus of control
4. being able to eat a lot of [[food]]
	1. ‘Have you noticed,’ said one rider, ‘how many pro-rider tweets and blogs and the like are concerned with [[food]]?’ Good point. The word ‘cake’ occurs almost as often as the word ‘bike’. ‘Most of them get through the long rides by bargaining with themselves about the cake at the cafe stop and what they’ll have for dinner.’ Calories out, calories in. The further you ride, the more you can eat. If you get it right you can eat like a black hole and still end up with the [[physiology]] of a hatstand. You can turn chocolate into gold.
	   
	   I still played the ‘another hour out here in the cold and I can have … ooh, what can I have? Maybe half a bar of Dairy Milk as a treat with my recovery drink. Then … hmmm … a roast beef sandwich. Or perhaps a rice pudding after dinner …’ and so on. Not, you’ll notice, a dream about four cheeseburgers and a bucket of Coke.^[Faster - The Obsession, Science and Luck Behind the World's Fastest Cyclists (by Michael Hutchinson), p. 108]
