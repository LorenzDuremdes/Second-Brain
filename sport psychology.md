# [[motivation]]
1. [[growth mindset]] vs. 'winning mindset'
	1. This outlook has some fantastic consequences for the mental stability of an athlete. One is that it stops defeat from being too discouraging – I’m guessing, but my suspicion is that the stars from his youth tended to quit when they started to lose. Another is that when you do win, it stops you from being satisfied with that. If you think you can do better, you’ll go right ahead and try to do better. As Dan Hunt put it, ‘**These guys can win Olympic gold, break the world record, do the event to the highest standard that anyone in the history of cycling has ever managed, and still come away thinking about how they can do it better next time.’ Winning is one thing – keeping winning is entirely another**.^[Faster - The Obsession, Science and Luck Behind the World's Fastest Cyclists (by Michael Hutchinson), p. 106]
