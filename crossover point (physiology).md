1. Fig. 2 The crossover concept. The relative decrease in [[energy]] derived from [[lipid]] (fat) as exercise intensity increases with a corresponding increase in carbohydrate (CHO). The crossover point describes when the CHO contribution to substrate oxidation supersedes that of fat. MFO: maximal fat oxidation.
