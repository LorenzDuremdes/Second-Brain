1. Fig. 2 The crossover concept. The relative decrease in [[energy]] derived from [[lipid]] ([[fat]]) as exercise intensity increases with a corresponding increase in [[carbohydrate]] (CHO). The crossover point describes when the CHO contribution to substrate oxidation supersedes that of [[fat]]. MFO: maximal [[fat]] oxidation.
