1. the first NREM episode is more likely to occur at theÂ steepest point of [[temperature]] decline^[[The Temperature Dependence of Sleep - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/)]
2. [[NREM sleep]] contributes to [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic stability]]^[[[PDF] Autonomic Dysfunction in Sleep Disorders: From Neurobiological Basis to Potential Therapeutic Approaches | Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/reader/f9d6a046ba7f1c5800768b8e4a0453774c18246f)]
3. parasympathetic tone increases as [[sleep]] progresses from NREM N1 [[sleep]] to the [[slow-wave sleep|deeper stages]], while sympathetic tone simultaneously decreases^[[[PDF] Autonomic Dysfunction in Sleep Disorders: From Neurobiological Basis to Potential Therapeutic Approaches | Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/reader/f9d6a046ba7f1c5800768b8e4a0453774c18246f)]
4. does [[core body temperature]] still decrease when [[circadian rhythm]] is desynchronized with the sleep cycle (e.g. going to bed earlier/later)?
	1. In experiments where the circadian rhythm is desynchronised from the sleep cycle, the effect of sleep itself on body temperature becomes clear: core temperature drops on every transition to NREM sleep^[[Contribution of the circadian pacemaker and the sleep homeostat to sleep propensity, sleep structure, electroencephalographic slow waves, and sleep spindle activity in humans - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6578184/)]^[[Sleep and thermoregulation - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7323637/)]
