1. pre-exercise hypohydration → VO2 max
	1. each percent of body weight loss above a threshold loss of 3% decreasing [[VO2 max]] by 2.9% (Figure 15.6)
	   
	   In 2010, Gigou et al. reported the results of a metaanalysis evaluating the effect of pre-exercise hypohydration on [[VO2 max]] and high-intensity, short-term [[aerobic exercise]] performance (i.e., ≤30  minutes). They demonstrated that both [[VO2 max]] (−2.4%) and performance (−3.2%) were impaired in a statistically significant manner by pre-exercise hypohydration ≥3% body weight. Although there was no association between the extent of hypohydration and changes in [[aerobic exercise]] performances, there was a significant association (random-effects model meta-regression) between hypohydration and [[VO2 max]], with each percent of body weight loss above a threshold loss of 3% decreasing [[VO2 max]] by 2.9% (Figure 15.6).  
  
It is however not clear how these variables would be affected by milder hypohydration levels (1–2%)^[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118692318] > ^[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118692318.ch15]
