1. pre-exercise hypohydration → VO2 max
	1. each percent of body weight loss above a threshold loss of 3% decreasing [[VO2 max]] by 2.9% (Figure 15.6)
	   
	   In 2010, Gigou et al. reported the results of a meta-analysis evaluating the effect of pre-exercise hypohydration on [[VO2 max]] and high-intensity, short-term [[aerobic exercise]] performance (i.e., ≤30  minutes). They demonstrated that both [[VO2 max]] (−2.4%) and performance (−3.2%) were impaired in a statistically significant manner by pre-exercise hypohydration ≥3% body weight. Although there was no association between the extent of hypohydration and changes in [[aerobic exercise]] performances, there was a significant association (random-effects model meta-regression) between hypohydration and [[VO2 max]], with each percent of body weight loss above a threshold loss of 3% decreasing [[VO2 max]] by 2.9% (Figure 15.6).  
  
It is however not clear how these variables would be affected by milder hypohydration levels (1–2%)^[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118692318] > ^[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118692318.ch15]
2. dehydration → [[heart rate]]
	1. ~4.06% (~3.16 kg) dehydration results in 81–86 beats/min (at 48 °C first 5 hours) compared to 65 beats/min at 28 °C^[GPT-4]^[Cardiovascular adjustments rogressive dehydration, DONALD H. HORSTMAN AND STEVEN M. HORVATH]
	2. **[[cardiac output]]** was maintained at about 10 liters/min during the entire exposure (7 hours), which is twice the control value observed during exposure at 28°C (5.1 liters/min)
	3. **stroke volume** was maintained between 107 and 124 ml/beat throughout the exposure, representing a 50% increase over the control value of 80 ml/beat at 28°C
