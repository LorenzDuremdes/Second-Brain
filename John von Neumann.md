1. John von Neumann and John Nash
	1. Von Neumann was sitting at an enormous desk, looking more like a prosperous bank president than an academic in his expensive three-piece suit, silk tie, and jaunty pocket handkerchief. He had the preoccupied air of a busy executive. At the time, he was holding a dozen consultancies, “arguing the ear off Robert Oppenheimer” over the development of the H-bomb, and overseeing the construction and programming of two prototype computers. He gestured Nash to sit down. He knew who Nash was, of course, but seemed a bit puzzled by his visit.

		He listened carefully, with his head cocked slightly to one side and his fingers tapping. Nash started to describe the proof he had in [[mind]]… But before he had gotten out more than a few disjointed sentences, von Neumann interrupted, jumped ahead to the as yet unstated conclusion of Nash’s argument, and said abruptly, “That’s trivial, you know. That’s just a fixed point theorem.”^[https://mattbaker.blog/2015/05/26/john-nash-and-the-theory-of-games/]

# negatives
1. how was John von Neumann with topics he was less prepared for?
	1. Another factor was that he did not find it easy to discuss a topic formally in writing to others unless it was already mature in his [[mind]]. If it was, he could talk freely and without hesitation, but if it was not, he would, in his own words, "develop the worst traits of pedantism and inefficiency".^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann#cite_note-FOOTNOTER%C3%A9deiSt%C3%B6ltzner2001168-439]
