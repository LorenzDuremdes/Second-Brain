1. how does sleep remove toxic waste?
	1. via the glymphatic system and cerebrospinal [[fluid]], mostly active during deep [[NREM sleep]] together with its sleep spindles as well as the shrinking of neurons by 60%

# improving sleep
1. should you think about physical activities to fall asleep (e.g. tennis)?
	1. no, because it can raise your [[blood pressure]] (i.e. simply imagining the activities)
		1. what about dreaming about such activities → effect on sleep quality/quantity?

# [[REM sleep]]
1. [[brain]] regions less active during [[REM sleep]]
	1. the far left and right sides of the prefrontal [[gyrus|cortex]]
		1. lateral prefrontal [[cortex]] (involved in [[prefrontal synthesis]])

# [[physical exercise]]
1. what could cause bad sleep Tuesday when going to ASSortiMens?
	1. exercising (cycling) relatively close to bedtime (rather than being overreached/overtrained)^[https://youtu.be/zRSebfjuoe8?t=2100]
2. high physical fatigue → [[NREM sleep|(N)REM sleep]]^[[How To Recover From A High Volume Training Week (Ask a Cycling Coach 274)](https://youtu.be/rKm3BNIWQoo?t=890)]
	1. you might shift to some more [[NREM sleep]] at the cost of [[REM sleep]] and vice versa for a while

# anecdotes
1. lack of (N)[[REM sleep]] → subjective fatigue
	1. a lack of [[NREM sleep]] personally feels less tiresome? e.g. getting in most [[REM sleep]] in the last hours and still [[feeling]] well despite having only slept for a couple hours
		1. can also be due to bupropion

# [[autism]]
1. Some of the genes responsible of regulating circadian rhythms seem to be mutated or down-regulated in ASD^[https://annals-general-psychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12991-022-00390-6#Sec1]
