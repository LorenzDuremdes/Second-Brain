# improving sleep
1. I’d never thought of sleep as something that could be engineered. The schools I attended didn’t offer sleep classes. No one pulled me aside and gave me tips. So, like most, I just crossed my fingers each day and hoped for the best until I read Matthew Walker’s book Why We Sleep, which introduced me to the science of sleep.
   
   First, close the blackout blinds in your bedroom. Eat dinner at 4pm, and do not eat or drink anything after 6pm. Put on your blue-light blocking glasses at 8pm. Set your bedroom [[temperature]] to 67ºF (19.4ºC) and your electric blanket to 69.8ºF (21ºC). At 8.45pm, meditate for five to ten minutes. Switch on your deep-wave sound machine. Put on your sleep-tracking [device]. You are now, finally, ready for slumber. This may all sound a bit over the top. But this is the “[[sleep hygiene]]” routine described in a recent blog post by Bryan Johnson, who sold his previous company to eBay for $800m and is now chief executive of Kernel, a startup developing [[brain]]-computer interfaces. He admits that his sleep routine has “decimated my social life”, and that his partner sleeps in a different room, but says all this trouble is worth it, because it has boosted his level of “deep sleep” by as much as 157%. He has bought [wearable sleep trackers] for all his employees.
   
   Such measures may seem extreme, but that’s what it takes to understand and break the connection between sleep and cookies. So what did I learn?
   
   I can predict with high accuracy what my sleep metrics will be if I eat a 6pm dinner instead of sticking to my normal 5am-10am window (my last meal of the day comes even earlier than described in the Economist’s article, nowadays!). I know the different impacts of various foods. I know the likely outcomes if I experience negative emotional [[arousal]] before bed. I know with high accuracy that if I eat that 6pm dinner, my sleep will be severely compromised which will obliterate my impulse control the following day and put me at high risk of kickstarting a vicious cycle.
   
   **my comment**: I come from a more road cycling background where you can measure all kinds of things (e.g. training load or TSS, power data, CdA...) and there's so much [[information]] (millions of research papers) there on how to optimize aerodynamics and your training to achieve an outcome, and I sometimes like to imagine this will be the case in the future with things like optimizing sleep for certain outcomes as well. Including (what we call in [[sports science]]) the 'marginal gains', which all combined can really stack up and produce big outcomes (e.g. saving 0.5 watts here and there for aerodynamics as a cyclist).^[[Sleep and Impulse Control.

	1. no, because it can raise your [[blood pressure]] (i.e. simply imagining the activities)

## technology
1. [[algorithm]] for optimal bedtime = >T<sub>morning</sub> - [[total sleep time|TST]]/x=0.85
	1. **>T**<sub>morning</sub>; moment when [[temperature]] increases next morning (as that's what wakes you up the most with sleeping mask or blinds)
	2. **0.85**; [[sleep efficiency]]
	3. **x**; [[time in bed|TIB]]; [[sleep onset latency|SOL]]+[[wake after sleep onset|WASO]]<sub>max</sub>
	4. e.g. if it increases at 6 AM in the [[summer]] with an average TST of 7h → go to bed at 6-(7/x=0.85)≈21:45 (SOL+WASO<sub>max</sub>=74m)
	5. what's another advantage of following an [[algorithm]] to determine optimal sleep times rather than guessing it intuitively?
		1. it can have many factors you don't think about determining the sleep times
		2. also makes you less doubtful e.g. sleep [[anxiety]]
		3. makes it function similarly as an RMR [[algorithm]] (as well as making you focus more on how to increase/decrease it and things around it e.g. exercise) → you have a certain budget and if you want to increase it, you have to find ways to do so
	6. why do you like to use SE=0.85 for calculating your optimal bedtime and waking [[time]]?
		1. it automatically allows for more TST if SE increases (which can be self-reinforcing of done right)
			1. e.g.:
				1. 5h with SE=0.85 gives TST≈5.9h and SOL+WASO=0.9h or if SE=0.95 gives TST=5.6h with SOL=18m
				2. 5.6h with SE=0.85 gives TST≈6.3h with SOL=20m if SE=0.95
				3. 6.3h with SE=0.85 gives TST≈7h with SOL=24m if SE=0.95

### apparel
1. should you sleep with socks on if it's cold + why
	1. Wearing socks can help a process called distal [[vasodilation]], which refers to an increase of [[blood]] to your hands and feet that reduces your core body [[temperature]] quicker.
	   
	   Increasing [[circulatory system|blood flow]] by warming the feet, either through wearing socks to bed or other means, can help you fall asleep quicker. In one research study, participants who used socks or other foot warming methods not only fell asleep quicker but they reported staying asleep longer and experiencing an overall better [[sleep quality|quality of sleep]].^[https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-hygiene/sleeping-with-socks-on]

2. walking (early) after waking up
3. learning (e.g. Anki) after waking upt

## [[circadian rhythm]]
1. how long and when should you warm yourself up throughout the day to improve sleep?
	1. In humans, immersion in hot water prior to, but not immediately before, the sleep period decreases sleep latency and increases sleep depth. This is the known as the ‘Warm Bath Effect’ ([Horne and Reid, 1985](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B59); [Parmeggiani, 1987](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B99); [Bunnell et al., 1988](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B17); [Shapiro et al., 1989](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B117); [Jordan et al., 1990](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B62); [Dorsey et al., 1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B32)). In fact, **warming for up to 4 h, between 1 and 8 h before to going to bed, increases slow wave sleep (SWS), increases NREM consolidation and decreases [[REM sleep]]**. This effect embodies a key connection between [[temperature]] and sleep. Warming, at the right [[time]], is causatively associated with sleep initiation. However, sleep initiation occurs within the decline of circadian [[temperature]] and NREM is associated with further reductions in the [[temperature]] of both core and the [[brain]] ([Alföldi et al., 1990](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B4); [Landolt et al., 1995](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B76); [Kräuchi and Wirz-Justice, 2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B71)).^[[The Temperature Dependence of Sleep - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/)]
2. should you increase the length of dark period or light period when wanting to e.g. adjust [[circadian rhythm]] or [[process S|sleep pressure]]?
	1. in many of these biological processes (e.g. operational control of the [[human]] [[immune system]]) the critical point is the length of the dark period rather than that of the light
	   
	   One consequence of artificial light pollution is that even brief periods of relatively bright light during the night may prevent plants or animals (including humans) from measuring the length of the dark period, and therefore from behaving in a normal or required manner. This is a critical aspect of [[scotobiology]], and one of the major areas in the study of the responses of biological systems to darkness.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotobiology]

## pre-bedtime
### [[temperature]]
1. [[water]]-based passive body heating (PBHWB) of 40-42.5 °C was associated with both improved self-rated [[sleep quality]] and [[sleep efficiency|SE]], and when scheduled 1-2 h before bedtime for little as 10 min significant shortening of [[sleep onset latency|SOL]]^[[Before-bedtime passive body heating by warm shower or bath to improve sleep: A systematic review and meta-analysis - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31102877/)] by approximately 36%^[[Sleep and thermoregulation - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7323637/)]
   
   "We know that your core body [[temperature]] needs to drop by about 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit to initiate good sleep and then maintain deep sleep," says Walker, the author of *Why We Sleep*.^[[Trouble Sleeping? Try A Warm Bath To Cool Down : Shots - Health News : NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/07/25/745010965/a-warm-bedtime-bath-can-help-you-cool-down-and-sleep-better)]
   1. is specific warming of the hands and feet (rather than a 'whole body shower') sufficient for the warm bath effect?
	   1. specific warming of the hands and feet promotes [[NREM sleep]] induction^[[Sleep and thermoregulation - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7323637/)]
1. the proximal-to-distal [[temperature]] gradient has to increase to improve sleep i.e. higher distal and lower proximal (core body) [[temperature]]
   
   Understanding how warmth might be encountered on a daily basis to precipitate these changes that initiate sleep and [[vasodilation]] is crucial. But it seems that the ‘warm bath effect’ is more subtle than previously thought. [Raymann et al. (2008)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B107) have extended the warming paradigm with the aid of a custom-made ‘thermosuit’ for the manipulation of skin [[temperature]]. Small changes in skin [[temperature]] of only 0.4°C (in the 31–35 range), can shorten sleep latencies without altering core [[temperature]].^[[The Temperature Dependence of Sleep - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/)]
   
   The circadian clock prepares the thermoregulatory system for [[vasodilation]] to begin in the early evening as sleepiness increases, followed by a drop in core body [[temperature]]. Even lying down increases sleepiness by redistributing heat in the body from the core to the periphery.
   
   A hotwater bottle at the feet, while not acting on mechanisms in the [[central nervous system]] that underly the regulation of sleep, can rapidly induce [[vasodilation]]. The resulting heat loss is most efficient when the ambient [[temperature]] is cool
   
   Thus, the greater the distal [[vasodilation]] in the late evening, the shorter was the [[time]] taken to fall asleep.^[[Warm feet promote the rapid onset of sleep | Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/43366)]
   
   **disruption of the peripheral vasodilatory response is sufficient to disrupt sleep**
   The circadian cycle and the onset of the first NREM episode are strongly linked. If sleep onset is postponed by [[sleep deprivation]], then the circadian [[temperature]] rhythm is disrupted. Similarly, a delay in core [[temperature]] decline of more than 2 h, is observed in patients with delayed sleep phase disorders (DSPDs) ([Ozaki et al., 1996](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B96); [van den Heuvel et al., 1998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B140); [Watanabe et al., 2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B147)). Disruption of the peripheral vasodilatory response is sufficient to disrupt sleep. For instance, those with difficulty in peripheral [[vasodilation]] (vasospastic disorders) have longer sleep latencies than healthy controls ([Pache et al., 2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B97)). Narcoleptic patients also have a strongly altered proximal-to-distal skin [[temperature]] gradient during daytime waking ([Fronczek et al., 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B38)). But manipulating the proximal-to-distal relationship can change sleep propensity. Warming of the core (proximal-skin) by less than 1°C, easily within the range encountered within the circadian day, is sufficient to shorten sleep latency ([Raymann et al., 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B106)). [[Temperature]] manipulation can also selectively and predictably alter vigilance states in patients with narcolepsy ([Fronczek et al., 2008a](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B39),[b](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B40)). Additional work in the clinic has shown that neonates are three times more likely to fall asleep within 30 min, if their distal-to-proximal skin gradient is greater than 2.5°C ([Abe and Kodama, 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B1)). Distal [[vasodilation]] and higher foot [[temperature]] in preterm neonates is also correlated with shorter wake bouts ([Barcat et al., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B5)).^[[The Temperature Dependence of Sleep - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/)]

## [[temperature]]
1. Optimal ambient temperatures, in combination with bedding, appear to be crucial for efficient sleep onset in humans ([Haskell et al., 1981](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B55); [Okamoto-Mizuno et al., 2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B95); [Raymann et al., 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B107)). Responses to external [[temperature]] also appear to be important as the extent of [[vasodilation]], particularly in the hands and feet (distal-skin), is a good predictor of sleep initiation ([Krauchi et al., 1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B68)). This [[vasodilation]] is usually considered part of the circadian [[temperature]] decline and is observed up to 2 h prior to the start of the first sleep episode, during the wake phase ([Krauchi et al., 2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B69)).
   
   In experiments where participants ‘self-selected’ their bed [[time]], subjects were most likely to select a moment when the body [[temperature]] was at its maximum rate of decline ([Campbell and Broughton, 1994](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B18)). As sleep approaches, core [[temperature]] and [[heart rate]] drop, and their steepest decline intersects ‘lights-off’ and sleep onset ([Figure 2B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/figure/F2/)). At this point the proximal-to-distal [[temperature]] gradient is as much as 1.5°C, but as core [[temperature]] falls the gradient reduces to about 0.5°C; a new cooler set-point is reached just after sleep onset. The lowest core [[temperature]] is observed about 2 h after ‘lights-off’ and sleep onset in _Homo sapiens_ ([Krauchi et al., 2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B69)). Under natural conditions, increased circulating melatonin also coincides with declining core [[temperature]] prior to sleep onset ([Krauchi et al., 1997](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B70); [Krauchi et al., 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B67); [Logan and McClung, 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/#B81)).^[[The Temperature Dependence of Sleep - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/)]
   
   Much like your sleep pattern, your body [[temperature]] also follows a 24-hour cycle as part of the _[[circadian rhythm]]_.  Generally speaking, your body [[temperature]] decreases at night and rises during the day (within 2-3°F normally).
   
   It turns out that there is a lot of variation among individuals in their [[temperature]] needs and preferences.  [Scientists](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01952376) have found a range of temperatures under the covers among people when they sleep, up to 5-10°F, which indicates that different people have different “set points” for their sleeping [[temperature]] and [[energy]] requirements.
   
   [A 2005 survey](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15402010bsm0304_3) also showed that personal preference for bedroom [[temperature]] was quite varied, as well.  Responses indicated ideal temperatures ranging from below 60°F up to 75°F.  Interestingly, the #2 most important factor the participants indicated for [[sleep quality]], second to location of sleep, was the [[temperature]].
   
   Not only do different people have various sleeping [[temperature]] needs, but each person may themselves have a range of [ideal sleeping temperatures](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140137308924552). Temperatures further outside a person’s ideal range result in increased discomfort and more interrupted sleep, making it crucial for each individual to find the right temperatures to achieve the best sleep possible.^[[Sleep Myth Debunked: The 68° Sleeping Temperature (eightsleep.com)](https://www.eightsleep.com/blog/temperature-sleep-myth-debunked)]

	   In young subjects, high-dose [[MK-677]] treatment resulted in an approximately 50% increase in the duration of stage IV and in a more than 20% increase in [[REM sleep]] as compared to placebo (p < 0.05). The frequency of deviations from normal sleep decreased from 42% under placebo to 8% under high-dose [[MK-677]] (p < 0.03). In older adults, treatment with [[MK-677]] was associated with a nearly 50% increase in [[REM sleep]] (p < 0.05) and a decrease in REM latency (p < 0.02). The frequency of deviations from normal sleep also decreased (p < 0.02). The present findings suggest that [[MK-677]] may simultaneously improve [[sleep quality]] and correct the relative hyposomatotropism of senescence.

# [[temperature]]
## [[core body temperature]]
1. why does core body temperature perhaps have to decrease to permit/improve (NREM) sleep as opposed to just having the environment 'replacing' the [[endtherm|endothermy]] without any decrease?
	1. perhaps because a lower core body temperature improves [[energy conservation]] and more can be allocated toward e.g. maintaining the body (which is more the case during NREM sleep → less the case during REM sleep hence lowering of core body temperature not as necessary?)
		1. 1. a too high ambient temperature would not result in this energy conservation (as it can speed up processes in the body even if it 'replaces' the endothermy) as well as making the transitions between (N)REM sleep more difficult
			1. the microclimate (which cannot be replaced solely by ambient temperature) can permit this process
		2. a too low ambient temperature would not facillitate those processes as the body has to work harder to keep [[homeostasis]]
		3. i.e. there's a new homeostatis to optimize all these processes
	2. The relationship between sleep and ambient temperature.

a, The changing relationship of skin to core temperature as mice approach the [[thermal neutral zone|thermoneutral zone]] (TNZ). This has similarities to the [[distal-proximal skin temperature|distal-proximal gradient]] in humans where vasodilation in distal regions increases peripheral skin temperature and facilitates heat redistribution from the core. Having reached the cooler night-time temperature, the formation and maintenance of warm microclimates minimises [[energy conservation|energy loss]] while maintaining [[vasodilation]]. b, The structure of sleep is sensitive to ambient temperature. In mice, increasing ambient temperature promotes NREM sleep until the upper threshold of the thermoneutral zone where it declines sharply most likely due to heat stress. REM sleep is maximised in a narrow thermal window that appears to align with the TNZ. It should be noted that the thermoneutral pulsing method employed in [9] did not fully replicate warm-induced increases in NREM sleep.^[[Sleep and thermoregulation - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7323637/)] ![[The relationship between sleep and ambient temperature.jpg]]

# [[nutrition]]
## [[nutrient timing]]
### [[circadian rhythm]]
1. many studies have examined the influence of meal timing as a consequence of circadian misalignment and as a contributor to circadian desynchrony resulting in metabolic dysfunction
	1. our study provides an additional link; that meal timing may influence [[sleep quality]] in addition to disturbing circadian rhythmicity

### [[sleep onset latency]]
1. eating within 3 h of bedtime is associated with a ~40% increase in the odds of nocturnal awakening after accounting for ethnicity and BMI^[[Does the Proximity of Meals to Bedtime Influence the Sleep of Young Adults? A Cross-Sectional Survey of University Students - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7215804/)]
	1. however, meal timing was not associated with SOL or sleep duration. Sensitivity analysis with different cut-off points for meal timing—within 2 h of bedtime and within 4 h of bedtime—revealed similar results (see Appendix B)
		1. the absence of a relationship between meal timing and sleep duration is less surprising because sleep duration is predominately determined by the [[time]] since last sleep and social factors such as hours of employment or study, which influence habitual bed- and wake-times
	2. normal [[digestion]] and gastroesophageal reflux may be responsible for the association between evening meal timing and nocturnal awakenings. Reflux has been shown to be associated with eating close to bedtime as well as disrupted sleep, and [[gastric emptying]] [[time]] is estimated to be between 2 and 4 h after meal ingestion
	3. a previous study of 300 patients with [[sleep apnea]] found that later meal timing was associated with longer objectively measured sleep latency, higher [[apnea]]-[[hypopnea]] index, and poorer [[subjective sleep quality]]
		1. However, in that study, the proximity of the final meal relative to bedtime was not evaluated. Rather, those with dinner times later than 8 p.m. were compared to those with earlier dinner times. The longer sleep latency observed in that study was small, in the order of 0.1 min on [[polysomnography]], and thus may not be well captured by self-reported measures of sleep latency in the current study.
	4. Afaghi and colleagues reported that the consumption of a high glycaemic index (GI) evening meal was associated with a shorter [[sleep onset latency]], while Crispim et al. found that high-calorie and high-[[fat]] meals within 60 min of sleep were correlated with longer sleep latency, decreased [[sleep efficiency]], and increased [[wake after sleep onset]]
2. according to our results, high caloric [[food]] intake preceding the sleeping period was correlated with greater [[sleep onset latency|sleep latency]] in [[women]] (nocturnal caloric intake correlated positively with sleep latency). In general, this meal took place between 30 and 60 minutes before the volunteers went to bed.^[https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.1476#d3e1098]
	1. contrary to previous studies, our results suggest that intake of high [[fat]] and [[carbohydrate]] foods preceding the sleeping period are associated with higher sleep latency. Other studies have demonstrated that individuals who ingested a high-glycemic index, [[carbohydrate]]-rich meal 4 hours prior to sleep presented a decrease in sleep latency.

# research
## function
1. is [[energy conservation]] the primary function of sleep + why
	1. It was proposed that a lower brain [[temperature]] would reduce cerebral [[metabolism]], conserve energy and assist other functions from immune regulation to circadian coordination (McGinty and Szymusiak, 1990). [[Conservation of energy]] for sleep in its entirety has also been proposed (Berger and Phillips, 1995). However, we have seen that when mammals of all sizes prioritise conservation of energy, extremes of hypometabolism in [[torpor]] and [[hibernation]] are selected at the expense of sleep (Ruf and Geiser, 2015). This suggests that [[energy conservation]] alone is not the primary function of sleep. Indeed, estimates of energy use over 24 h put the cost of sleep as high as 85–95% of the [[basal metabolic rate|metabolic cost]] of waking (Jung et al., 2011; Abreu-Vieira et al., 2015; Hibi et al., 2017).^[[The Temperature Dependence of Sleep - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491889/)]
