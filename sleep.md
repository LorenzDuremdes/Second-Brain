1. how does sleep remove toxic waste?
	1. via the glymphatic system and cerebrospinal [[fluid]], mostly active during deep [[NREM sleep]] together with its sleep spindles as well as the shrinking of neurons by 60%

# improving sleep
1. should you think about physical activities to fall asleep (e.g. tennis)?
	1. no, because it can raise your [[blood pressure]] (i.e. simply imagining the activities)
		1. what about dreaming about such activities → effect on [[sleep quality]]/quantity?

# [[nutrition]]
## [[nutrient timing]]
1. According to our results, high caloric food intake preceding the sleeping period was correlated with greater sleep latency in women (nocturnal caloric intake correlated positively with sleep latency). In general, this meal took place between 30 and 60 minutes before the volunteers went to bed.^[https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.1476#d3e1098]
   
   Contrary to previous studies,[18](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.1476#B18),[19](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.1476#B19) our results suggest that intake of high [[fat]] and carbohydrate foods preceding the sleeping period are associated with higher sleep latency. Other studies[19](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.1476#B19),[20](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.1476#B20) have demonstrated that individuals who ingested a high-glycemic index, carbohydrate-rich meal 4 hours prior to sleep presented a decrease in sleep latency.

# [[REM sleep]]
1. [[brain]] regions less active during [[REM sleep]]
	1. the far left and right sides of the prefrontal [[gyrus|cortex]]
		1. lateral prefrontal [[cortex]] (involved in [[prefrontal synthesis]])

# [[physical exercise]]
1. what could cause bad sleep Tuesday when going to ASSortiMens?
	1. exercising (cycling) relatively close to bedtime (rather than being overreached/overtrained)^[https://youtu.be/zRSebfjuoe8?t=2100]
2. high physical fatigue → [[NREM sleep|(N)REM sleep]]^[[How To Recover From A High Volume Training Week (Ask a Cycling Coach 274)](https://youtu.be/rKm3BNIWQoo?t=890)]
	1. you might shift to some more [[NREM sleep]] at the cost of [[REM sleep]] and vice versa for a while

# anecdotes
1. lack of (N)[[REM sleep]] → subjective fatigue
	1. a lack of [[NREM sleep]] personally feels less tiresome? e.g. getting in most [[REM sleep]] in the last hours and still [[feeling]] well despite having only slept for a couple hours
		1. can also be due to bupropion

1. being [[female]] is a strong predictor of [[dyssomnia|poor sleep quality]]^[[Sleep Quality in Autism from Adolescence to Old Age | Autism in Adulthood (liebertpub.com)](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aut.2019.0034)]
	1. e.g. due to being more vulnerable to [[anxiety]] and [[depression]], and hormonal differences (e.g. menstruation)
2. **[[mother|maternal]] [[circadian rhythm|sleep patterns]]** (particularly late bedtimes) and overall lifestyle during pregnancy can influence the fetal environment and potentially contribute to the development of ASD^[[Biological correlates of altered circadian rhythms, autonomic functions and sleep problems in autism spectrum disorder](https://annals-general-psychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12991-022-00390-6#Sec3)]

### [[circadian rhythm]]
1. Some of the genes responsible of regulating circadian rhythms seem to be mutated or down-regulated in ASD^[https://annals-general-psychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12991-022-00390-6#Sec1]
	1. [[circadian rhythm|circadian]] [[hormone|hormones]] such as [[melatonin]] and [[cortisol]] were also found to be altered in ASD
2. **Higher evening levels of [[cortisol]], as well as a blunted diurnal slope**, were reported in ASD individuals with respect to controls. According to these authors, evening [[cortisol]] levels seemed to increase through [[developmental biology|development]] in ASD individuals, being higher in [[adolescence|adolescents]] than in [[child (human)|children]], whereas morning levels of the [[hormone]] were generally lower. The authors also suggested that the increase in [[cortisol]] level may be involved in the impaired [[sleep quality]]^[https://annals-general-psychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12991-022-00390-6#ref-CR48]
