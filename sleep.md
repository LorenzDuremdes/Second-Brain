# improving sleep
1. I’d never thought of sleep as something that could be engineered. The schools I attended didn’t offer sleep classes. No one pulled me aside and gave me tips. So, like most, I just crossed my fingers each day and hoped for the best until I read Matthew Walker’s book Why We Sleep, which introduced me to the science of sleep.
   
   First, close the blackout blinds in your bedroom. Eat dinner at 4pm, and do not eat or drink anything after 6pm. Put on your blue-light blocking glasses at 8pm. Set your bedroom temperature to 67ºF (19.4ºC) and your electric blanket to 69.8ºF (21ºC). At 8.45pm, meditate for five to ten minutes. Switch on your deep-wave sound machine. Put on your sleep-tracking [device]. You are now, finally, ready for slumber. This may all sound a bit over the top. But this is the “[[sleep hygiene]]” routine described in a recent blog post by Bryan Johnson, who sold his previous company to eBay for $800m and is now chief executive of Kernel, a startup developing [[brain]]-computer interfaces. He admits that his sleep routine has “decimated my social life”, and that his partner sleeps in a different room, but says all this trouble is worth it, because it has boosted his level of “deep sleep” by as much as 157%. He has bought [wearable sleep trackers] for all his employees.
   
   Such measures may seem extreme, but that’s what it takes to understand and break the connection between sleep and cookies. So what did I learn?
   
   I can predict with high accuracy what my sleep metrics will be if I eat a 6pm dinner instead of sticking to my normal 5am-10am window (my last meal of the day comes even earlier than described in the Economist’s article, nowadays!). I know the different impacts of various foods. I know the likely outcomes if I experience negative emotional [[arousal]] before bed. I know with high accuracy that if I eat that 6pm dinner, my sleep will be severely compromised which will obliterate my impulse control the following day and put me at high risk of kickstarting a vicious cycle.
   
   **my comment**: I come from a more road cycling background where you can measure all kinds of things (e.g. training load or TSS, power data, CdA...) and there's so much [[information]] (millions of research papers) there on how to optimize aerodynamics and your training to achieve an outcome, and I sometimes like to imagine this will be the case in the future with things like optimizing sleep for certain outcomes as well. Including (what we call in [[sports science]]) the 'marginal gains', which all combined can really stack up and produce big outcomes (e.g. saving 0.5 watts here and there for aerodynamics as a cyclist).^[[Sleep and Impulse Control.

2. should you think about physical activities to fall asleep (e.g. tennis)?
	1. no, because it can raise your [[blood pressure]] (i.e. simply imagining the activities)
		1. what about dreaming about such activities → effect on [[sleep quality]]/quantity?

Conclusions: Mouth-taping during sleep improved snoring and the severity of [[sleep apnea]] in mouth-breathers with mild OSA, with [[apnea]]/[[hypopnea]] index (AHI) and SI being reduced by about half. The higher the level of baseline AHI and snoring index (SI), the greater the improvement was shown after mouth-taping. Mouth-taping could be an alternative treatment in patients with mild OSA before turning to CPAP therapy or surgical intervention.^[[The Impact of Mouth-Taping in Mouth-Breathers with Mild Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Preliminary Study - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9498537/)]

## increasing sleep pressure
1. how can you perhaps estimate beforehand whether you built sufficient sleep pressure in the morning or not?
	1. assess sleep pressure during the short afternoon dip (e.g. adenosine)
2. walking (early) after waking up
3. learning (e.g. Anki) after waking upt

## [[circadian rhythm]]
1. should you increase the length of dark period or light period when wanting to e.g. adjust [[circadian rhythm]] or [[process S|sleep pressure]]?
	1. in many of these biological processes (e.g. operational control of the human [[immune system]]) the critical point is the length of the dark period rather than that of the light
	   
	   One consequence of artificial light pollution is that even brief periods of relatively bright light during the night may prevent plants or animals (including humans) from measuring the length of the dark period, and therefore from behaving in a normal or required manner. This is a critical aspect of [[scotobiology]], and one of the major areas in the study of the responses of biological systems to darkness.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotobiology]

## pre-bedtime
1. [[water]]-based passive body heating (PBHWB) of 40-42.5 °C was associated with both improved self-rated [[sleep quality]] and [[sleep efficiency|SE]], and when scheduled 1-2 h before bedtime for little as 10 min significant shortening of [[sleep onset latency|SOL]]^[[Before-bedtime passive body heating by warm shower or bath to improve sleep: A systematic review and meta-analysis - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31102877/)]
   
   "We know that your core body temperature needs to drop by about 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit to initiate good sleep and then maintain deep sleep," says Walker, the author of *Why We Sleep*.^[[Trouble Sleeping? Try A Warm Bath To Cool Down : Shots - Health News : NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/07/25/745010965/a-warm-bedtime-bath-can-help-you-cool-down-and-sleep-better)]

## [[food]]
### pre-bedtime
1. what should the composition of the meal be if you want to eat before bedtime?
	1. Evening whey [[protein]] supplementation, rich in tryptophan, does not improve acute sleep duration or quality in elite male Australian Football League players. However, elite athletes may be able to ingest a high [[protein]]/[[energy]] intake close to bedtime without impairing sleep, which is important for athlete recovery.^[[Evening Whey Protein Intake, Rich in Tryptophan, and Sleep in Elite Male Australian Rules Football Players on Training and Nontraining Days - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34875624/)]^[[[PDF] The Impact of Dietary Factors on the Sleep of Athletically Trained Populations: A Systematic Review | Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/reader/950985f4337895eac5a687522ffd60323bdd898c), discussion (page 18)]
	2. evening [[protein]] intake (gkg-1) was associated with shortened SOL [β=-2, 95%CI: -4 to -0.4), p=0.02]^[[Nutrient intake, meal timing and sleep in elite male Australian football players - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32624442/)]
2. high vs. low GI evening meal → sleep
	1. The evening intake of high GI carbohydrates was associated with improvements in sleep latency, WASO, and [[sleep efficiency]] in two studies of athletically trained populations. In a double- randomized crossover study of recreationally trained males, consumption of a high GI meal (containing 2 g·kg−1 carbohydrates) immediately post evening sprint exercises increased [[total sleep time]] and [[sleep efficiency]], and decreased WASO and sleep latency compared to a low GI meal as measured by [[polysomnography]]^[[[PDF] The Impact of Dietary Factors on the Sleep of Athletically Trained Populations: A Systematic Review | Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/reader/950985f4337895eac5a687522ffd60323bdd898c)]

## [[music]]
1. in direct comparisons, [[music]] has improved [[sleep quality]] greater than audiobooks and has been comparable to sedative hypnotics. In addition, [[music]] can be combined with relaxation techniques such as breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation. One review of non-pharmacological sleep aids identified [[music]] as the only sleep aid with adequate research.
   
   research suggests that [[music]] contributes to higher perceived [[sleep quality]], greater [[sleep efficiency]], [[total sleep time|longer sleep durations]], [[wake after sleep onset|less sleep disturbance]], and less daytime dysfunction for older adults.
   
   [[Music]] can reduce [[sympathetic nervous system]] activity, decrease [[blood pressure]] and [[heart rate]]. The decrease in Systolic [[Blood pressure]], [[diastolic blood pressure|Diastolic Blood pressure]], and [[heart rate]] signal a state of calmness, which is essential for having a good night sleep. Sedative [[music]], which is characterized by a slow tempo, repetitive rhythm, gentle contours, and strings, is effective in generating [[anxiolytic]] responses to aid sleep.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_and_sleep]

2. every minute in the **morning** (e.g. [[light therapy]], [[food]] or [[physical exercise]]) can affect e.g. sleep latency that night
	1. (loud) [[music]] can help waking up
3. every stressor that day can affect your sleep that same night
4. slow movements

## [[dysautonomia]]
1. extra [[sodium chloride|salt]]/[[electrolyte|electrolytes]] and [[fluid]]

### [[food]]
1. how do you like to use [[food]] before sleeping?
	1. mindful eating (and calming) especially with being hungry before from [[intermittent fasting]] ([[contrast effect]])
2. do you like flushing your mouth after eating before bedtime (but after brushing teeth) + why
	1. no, the sensations of [[food]] calms you (especially after hunger with IF)
	2. it's usually [[food]] that doesn't contain much sugar

# [[nutrition]]
## [[nutrient timing]]
### [[circadian rhythm]]
1. many studies have examined the influence of meal timing as a consequence of circadian misalignment and as a contributor to circadian desynchrony resulting in metabolic dysfunction
	1. our study provides an additional link; that meal timing may influence [[sleep quality]] in addition to disturbing circadian rhythmicity

### [[sleep onset latency]]
1. eating within 3 h of bedtime is associated with a ~40% increase in the odds of nocturnal awakening after accounting for ethnicity and BMI^[[Does the Proximity of Meals to Bedtime Influence the Sleep of Young Adults? A Cross-Sectional Survey of University Students - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7215804/)]
	1. however, meal timing was not associated with SOL or sleep duration. Sensitivity analysis with different cut-off points for meal timing—within 2 h of bedtime and within 4 h of bedtime—revealed similar results (see Appendix B)
		1. the absence of a relationship between meal timing and sleep duration is less surprising because sleep duration is predominately determined by the [[time]] since last sleep and social factors such as hours of employment or study, which influence habitual bed- and wake-times
	2. normal [[digestion]] and gastroesophageal reflux may be responsible for the association between evening meal timing and nocturnal awakenings. Reflux has been shown to be associated with eating close to bedtime as well as disrupted sleep, and [[gastric emptying]] [[time]] is estimated to be between 2 and 4 h after meal ingestion
	3. a previous study of 300 patients with [[sleep apnea]] found that later meal timing was associated with longer objectively measured sleep latency, higher [[apnea]]-[[hypopnea]] index, and poorer [[subjective sleep quality]]
		1. However, in that study, the proximity of the final meal relative to bedtime was not evaluated. Rather, those with dinner times later than 8 p.m. were compared to those with earlier dinner times. The longer sleep latency observed in that study was small, in the order of 0.1 min on [[polysomnography]], and thus may not be well captured by self-reported measures of sleep latency in the current study.
	4. Afaghi and colleagues reported that the consumption of a high glycaemic index (GI) evening meal was associated with a shorter [[sleep onset latency]], while Crispim et al. found that high-calorie and high-[[fat]] meals within 60 min of sleep were correlated with longer sleep latency, decreased [[sleep efficiency]], and increased [[wake after sleep onset]]
2. according to our results, high caloric [[food]] intake preceding the sleeping period was correlated with greater [[sleep onset latency|sleep latency]] in [[women]] (nocturnal caloric intake correlated positively with sleep latency). In general, this meal took place between 30 and 60 minutes before the volunteers went to bed.^[https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.1476#d3e1098]
	1. contrary to previous studies, our results suggest that intake of high [[fat]] and [[carbohydrate]] foods preceding the sleeping period are associated with higher sleep latency. Other studies have demonstrated that individuals who ingested a high-glycemic index, [[carbohydrate]]-rich meal 4 hours prior to sleep presented a decrease in sleep latency.
