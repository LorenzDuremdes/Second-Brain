1. what should you move to a higher [[cache]] hierarchy ([[Anki]]) from [[Obsidian.md]]?
	1. [[adaptive replacement cache]] → the one you expect most to use (quantity and/or [[time]])
		1. [[goal]] → [[intelligence]]
2. [[construal level theory]] → [[cache]] hierarchy
	1. usually, the higher the [[cache]] hierarchy, the higher the CLT
		1. it's also usually more [[mathematical optimization|optimal]] this way e.g. [[metacognition]] (higher-level construal) above [[cognition]]
3. model → [[cache]] hierarchy
	1. models usually reside in a relatively high [[cache]] hierarchy

# [[von Neumann architecture]]
1. [[quantum computing|quantum computer]] · [[central processing unit|CPU]] → [[cache]] hierarchy
	1. CPU might be a higher [[cache]] hierarchy? e.g. CPU commanding quantum computer what to calculate and storing what's important (in a compressed format)
