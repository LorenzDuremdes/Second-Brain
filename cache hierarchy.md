1. what should you move to a higher cache hierarchy ([[Anki]]) from [[Obsidian.md]]?
	1. [[adaptive cache replacement]] → the one you expect most to use (quantity and/or time)
		1. goal → [[intelligence]]
2. [[construal level theory]] → cache hierarchy
	1. usually, the higher the cache hierarchy, the higher the CLT
		1. it's also usually more [[mathematical optimization|optimal]] this way e.g. metacognition (higher-level construal) above cognition
3. model → cache hierarchy
	1. models usually reside in a relatively high cache hierarchy
