1. decoupling (cosmology); refers to a period in the development of the universe when different types of particles fall out of thermal equilibrium with each other^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoupling_(cosmology)]
	1. This occurs as a result of the expansion of the universe, as their interaction rates decrease (and mean free paths increase) up to this critical point. The two verified instances of decoupling since the Big Bang which are most often discussed are photon decoupling and [[neutrino]] decoupling, as these led to the cosmic microwave background and cosmic [[neutrino]] background, respectively.
