1. spaced repetition → [[repetition suppression]]
	1. a (too) short interval might induce [[repetition suppression]] and reduce [[Levels of Processing model|levels-of-processing effect]]
2. images → spaced repetition
	1. adding images to items can help with ordering [[knowledge]] (and make you feel like you haven't learned nothing)
	2. increases [[germane cognitive load]] efficiency, allowing this process to happen more easily? e.g. minimizing the minimum required extracted synaptic patterns
3. spaced repetition → more complex [[knowledge]]
	1. A more recent study has shown that spaced repetition can benefit tasks such as solving math problems. In a study conducted by Pashler, Rohrer, Cepeda, and Carpenter, participants had to learn a simple math principle in either a spaced or massed retrieval schedule. The participants given the spaced repetition learning tasks showed higher scores on a final test distributed after their final practice session.

# dementia
1. throughout the development of spaced repetition they have found that patients using this technique with dementia are able to recall the [[information]] weeks—even months—later

3. Joltin et al. (2003), had a caregiver train a woman with Alzheimer's by giving her the name of her grandchild over the phone while asking her to associate with the picture of the grandchild posted on the refrigerator. After training, the woman was able to recall the name of her grandchild five days later.

# spaced repetition software
1. more successful students tend to have a lower relative retention percentage
	1. The interpretation of this paradoxical finding is that good students are by far more critical in the judgment of their own progress.^[http://www.super-memory.com/english/ol/analysis30.htm]
2. why does Dr. Piotr Wozniak think halving the post-lapse interval is less efficient than 1 to 4 days?
	1. because it slows down the identification of leeches^[https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Post-lapse_stability]
	3. and also detecting [[interference theory|interference]]
