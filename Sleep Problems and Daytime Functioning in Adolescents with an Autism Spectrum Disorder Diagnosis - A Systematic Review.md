1. The **underlying cause** of the increased prevalence of [[sleep]] problems in people with ASD has not been fully clarified, but it seems to be associated with several **ASD related factors** (Cortesi et al., 2010) **such as biological abnormalities** (e.g., disturbed production of [[melatonin]]), medical or psychological co-occurring conditions (e.g., [[epilepsy]], [[anxiety]]), and use of [[medication]] to treat the co-occurring conditions (Johnson & Malow, 2008)

# adolescence
1. Given our **focus on adolescence**, **developmental factors** have been identified that also contribute to [[dyssomnia|sleep problems]]. Developmental factors specific for adolescent age further interfere with [[circadian rhythm|sleep wake patterns]] at this age, as a prominent [[sleep]] phase shift is seen, resulting in later [[sleep onset latency|sleep timing]] and increasing differences in rise time between week and weekend days (Moore & Meltzer, 2008).

# practical applications
## [[psychology]]
1. On a group level, **total [[sleep]] time can be increased by creating awareness about the importance of [[sleep]] and [[sleep]] hygiene** (Keogh et al., 2019).
	1. Other interventions, such as faded bedtime and [[sleep]] restriction, are also effective in initiating, and maintaining [[sleep]] (Johnson & Zarrinnegar, 2020).

## [[biochemistry]]
1. On the other hand, **problems with [[circadian rhythm|sleep-wake patterns]] require** [[sleep]] timing interventions with, if necessary, light exposure and [[melatonin]] suppletion (Johnson & Zarrinnegar, 2020).
