1. protozoa; a polyphyletic group of single-celled [[eukaryote|eukaryotes]], either free-living or [[parasitism|parasitic]], that feed on organic matter such as other [[microorganism|microorganisms]] or organic debris.
   
   Historically, protozoans were regarded as "one-celled animals".

Traditional textbook examples of protozoa are [[Amoeba (genus)|Amoeba]], Paramecium, Euglena and Trypanosoma.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa]
