1. [[sleep]] deprivation → hypnogram
	1. during rest following a [[sleep]]-deprived state, there is a period of rebound [[sleep]] which has longer and deeper episodes of SWS to make up for the lack of [[sleep]]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnogram]
2. [[sleep]] deprivation → Glx vs. GABA
	1. [[Sleep]] affects not only neural plasticity but also the concentrations of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters and the E/I balance in animal and human brains. A recent animal study showed that the E/I balance of synaptic activity changes across the 24-h day in a [[sleep]]-dependent manner. Inhibitory processing was upregulated during [[sleep]], while excitatory processing was downregulated during [[sleep]]. The result indicates that the E/I balance is not fixed but dynamically changes in a [[sleep]]-dependent manner. A human MRS study showed that [[sleep]] deprivation increased the concentration of Glx in the [[basal ganglia]] compared with that before [[sleep]] deprivation, whereas the concentration of GABA was unchanged.^[[Are sleep disturbances a cause or consequence of autism spectrum disorder? - Yamada - 2023 - Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences - Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pcn.13550)]
