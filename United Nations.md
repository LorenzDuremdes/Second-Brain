1. why is the United Nations not entirely a 'peace organization'?^[https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/34tt7j/comment/cqxzoqb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
	1. because it has to be 'realistic' and e.g. allow war between countries
	2. 'realistic'=having as many people agree and reduce spillover of war
3. what's the purpose of the UN **veto power**?
	1. UN was setup with one clear goal - to prevent a new world war. If you strip a veto power from one its core members they might just walk away like it happened with the League of Nations and there will be no more options left to conduct diplomacy.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/t24yr6/comment/hykdq9z/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
