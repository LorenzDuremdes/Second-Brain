1. how does the conservation law function in [[quantum mechanics]]?
	1. for instance, if a particle with no angular momentum decays into two particles, each of which have angular momentum, we know that the angular momentum of the particles must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction- so that the angular momentum of the child particles is the same as that of the parent^[https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1hot0y/what_would_happen_if_i_entangled_two_particles/cawiues?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
2. what happens to the other entangled particle when its partner gets changed (e.g. falling into a black hole)?
	1. they simply get unentangled^[https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1hot0y/what_would_happen_if_i_entangled_two_particles/cawiues?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]^[https://van.physics.illinois.edu/QA/listing.php?id=24514&t=what-if-an-entangled-photon-gets-destroyed]
