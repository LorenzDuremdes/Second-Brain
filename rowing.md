**optimal rowing stroke rates**:
**18-22 spm** - At lower stroke rates, the flywheel has more time to slow down between each stroke. So, it will take more work to get it up to speed. This increases the load and feel of the stroke. Lower stroke rates are useful for practicing technique, stroke sequence, and rhythm—but may feel more like a strength workout than an aerobic workout. Long hard workouts at this stroke rate are not recommended.
**24-28 spm** - These stroke rates tend to be comfortable for steady state workouts. These rates are slow enough to allow for good, strong technique that can be maintained. This range is recommended for longer workouts.
**30-36 spm** - Higher stroke rates are easier to maintain over short distances. These stroke rates demand fast twitch muscles and speedy coordination. Higher stroke rates are best practiced with interval training and for racing distances up to 2000 meters.
**38+ spm** - Adept crews and athletes use high stroke rates for racing and short distances. At the World Rowing Championships, fast men’s crews finished some races at 47 spm! There is an upper limit to efficient use of the stroke. It would be difficult to achieve greater speed much above this spm given the complexities of the stroke and best use of the large muscle groups (such as the legs, which should be used at full compression).

You will find an optimal stroke rate for your best rowing. Some shorter athletes find that they can maintain faster stroke rates than their taller peers! The best stroke rate is one that you can maintain for the amount of work time (or distance) demanded with good technique. If you increase your stroke rate but cannot maintain it, then it is recommended that you decrease your stroke rate. If you increase your stroke rate but don’t see your pace improve, that is a sign that your technique is suffering. Decrease your stroke rate to where you gain speed by rowing correctly. The goal is to row well to row fast.
Note: Stroke rates are often discussed as even numbers, but workouts can also be done at odd stroke rates (19, 21, etc.) and will sometimes show up on the PM as halves (22 ½ spm). With stroke by stroke data, it can be a challenge to maintain the exact same rate throughout

   If you’re rowing with intensity: yes. It’s intense cardio workout but also strength endurance. A selling point is that it engages 84% of your muscles, but the flip side is that means it’s tiring and pretty much throughout your body. You know the feeling when you’re gassing out on a run or cycle? Or how about the feeling up muscle fatigue and lactic acid burn finishing a difficult weightlifting set? Basically combine both those feelings at once and that’s what rowing is like at a high intensity.
   
   And the intensity is completely up to the user. On a treadmill I can set a speed. I simply need to keep up and it will guarantee I’m doing that speed. It also takes far less of a mental toll as I don’t really have to think about much beyond enduring. Rowing takes more focus on maintaining intensity and also form especially as you’re tiring.
   
   The flip side is there’s lots a reward with rowing. You’re getting cardio and a type of full body resistance training. You gain mental strength and even an adrenaline hit. But it definitely comes with taking on the difficult nature of it. There’s an interview out there with Hugh Jackman on his love of indoor rowing and he talks about why it’s one of the most avoided pieces of gym equipment because it’s hard.

   Others have offered well-reasoned insight, but I’ll add my experience. I’m mostly a middle-distance (here in my late middle age) trail runner. I picked up a C2 bc I’m starting to spend more and more time injured. In the very brief time I’ve been building up to 10k sessions, my lung capacity and endurance on the trails has SKYROCKETED. Idk if it’s the steady state, no break aspect or the omfggggg I’m so bored and have to learn to simultaneously focus and relax part, but it’s been a game changer for me. Extremely grateful this came into my life, no fuckin joke
   >This was my experience as well. C2 rower improved all of my endurance/capacity metrics regardless of specificity. Best shape I’ve ever been in and it’s not even close

	Rowing is a power endurance sport. Not a sprint, and not a pure endurance thing. Intermittent explosiveness. Very few sports or even sport movements are as focused on power endurance as is rowing.
	
	Power endurance is painful. Our old joke was "why do you row?" "Feels so good when I stop!" And the number of true power endurance athletes genetically speaking is much lower than the number of sprinter or long distance body types. Everybody can do it but statistically, very few people can be competitive.
	
	In short, it's normal to find it difficult. 
2. I have no scientific way to prove it, but as a former pro rower, and current marathon runner (among other things) I can say almost certainly that rowing is more physically demanding than running (that applies to regular running, not sprints or HIIT, which can be extremely demanding as well). Since rowing is biomechanically a complex move (you're utilizing your entire body to deliver the necessary force compared to running which uses legs mostly) even at lower intensities you'll be burning a lot of calories as your heart rate will most of the time be above that fat burning zone of 60-70% (which is very difficult to maintain on the erg).[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/a1k1fi/rowing_machine_vs_running/]

   I may be a bit biased since I was a rower in college, but I would say rowing. Rowing is truly a full body workout. It works your legs, back, core, and a little bit of your arms. On top of that you get a great cardio workout. One thing though is you really need to make sure you are using the erg correctly. I have seen some pretty horrendous rowing techniques at the gym. Here's a video that explains it. It's really important that you do the stroke correctly. If you're doing it wrong you're not only getting a bad workout, but you could also really hurt yourself.

   I never realized how fucking physically demanding rowing was until I tried it for a season this year. I'll tell you what, I've played hockey for 16 years and it doesn't even compare to rowing in a 6000m regatta, that shit straight sucks.

   Rowing is probably one of the most physically demanding sports. I rowed for 3 years in college and it put me in the best shape I have ever been in. It's tough but nothing is more amazing feeling when you and three other (or 7 if its an 8 person boat) people get into a perfect sync and you just glide across the water. I absolutely loved rowing and still try to get out on the water on occasion. In the video, these girls are in a 2k sprint. Usually you do 6k in the fall and 2k in the spring.
