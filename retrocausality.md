1. retrocausality; a concept of cause and effect in which an effect precedes its cause in [[time]] and so a later event affects an earlier one.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrocausality#cite_note-SEP-1]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrocausality#cite_note-2]
	1. retrocausality is associated with the Double Inferential state-Vector Formalism (DIVF), later known as the [[two-state vector formalism]] (TSVF) in [[quantum mechanics]], where the present is characterised by quantum states of the past and the future taken in combination.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrocausality#cite_note-Watanabe1955-17]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrocausality#cite_note-18]
