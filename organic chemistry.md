1. organic [[chemistry]]; a branch of [[chemistry]] that studies the structure, properties and reactions of organic compounds, which contain [[carbon]] in covalent bonding
	1. why "covalent bonding"?
2. Three representations of an organic compound, 5Î±-Dihydroprogesterone (5Î±-DHP), a steroid hormone. For molecules showing color, the [[carbon]] atoms are in black, hydrogens in gray, and oxygens in red. In the [[line]] angle representation, [[carbon]] atoms are implied at every terminus of a [[line]] and vertex of multiple lines, and hydrogen atoms are implied to fill the remaining needed valences (up to 4).
