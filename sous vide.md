1. sous vide; a method of cooking invented by the French chef Georges Pralus in 1974,[5][6] in which [[food]] is placed in a plastic pouch or a glass jar and cooked in a water bath for longer than usual cooking times (usually one to seven hours, and more than three days in some cases) at a precisely regulated [[temperature]].
   
   The temperature is much lower than usually used for cooking, typically around 55 to 60 °C (130 to 140 °F) for [[red meat]], 66 to 71 °C (150 to 160 °F) for poultry, and higher for vegetables. The intent is to cook the item evenly, ensuring that the inside is properly cooked without overcooking the outside, and to retain moisture.
