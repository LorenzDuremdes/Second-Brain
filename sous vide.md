1. sous vide; a method of cooking invented by the French chef Georges Pralus in 1974,[5][6] in which [[food]] is placed in a plastic pouch or a glass jar and cooked in a water bath for longer than usual cooking times (usually one to seven hours, and more than three days in some cases) at a precisely regulated [[temperature]].
   
   The temperature is much lower than usually used for cooking, typically around 55 to 60 째C (130 to 140 째F) for [[red meat]], 66 to 71 째C (150 to 160 째F) for poultry, and higher for vegetables. The intent is to cook the item evenly, ensuring that the inside is properly cooked without overcooking the outside, and to retain moisture.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sous_vide]
