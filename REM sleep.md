	1. tonic; characterized by theta rhythms in the [[brain]]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep#Timing] + a unique phase accompanied by low muscle tone throughout the body^[[[PDF] Autonomic Dysfunction in Sleep Disorders: From Neurobiological Basis to Potential Therapeutic Approaches | Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/reader/f9d6a046ba7f1c5800768b8e4a0453774c18246f)]
	2. phasic; characterized by ponto-geniculo-occipital waves (originating in the [[brain stem]])^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep#Timing] + sympathetically driven phasic REM [[sleep]] is inter mittently accompanied by rapid eye movements and cardiorespiratory fluctuations during the dream state^[[[PDF] Autonomic Dysfunction in Sleep Disorders: From Neurobiological Basis to Potential Therapeutic Approaches | Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/reader/f9d6a046ba7f1c5800768b8e4a0453774c18246f)]
2. the autonomic balance shifts from parasympathetic to sympathetic dominance when [[sleep]] enters the REM stage, and the [[heart rate]] and [[blood pressure]] increase abruptly^[[[PDF] Autonomic Dysfunction in Sleep Disorders: From Neurobiological Basis to Potential Therapeutic Approaches | Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/reader/f9d6a046ba7f1c5800768b8e4a0453774c18246f)]
