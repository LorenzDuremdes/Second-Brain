1. REM [[sleep]] (sublcasses):
	1. tonic; characterized by theta rhythms in the [[brain]]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep#Timing] + a unique phase accompanied by low muscle tone throughout the body^[[[PDF] Autonomic Dysfunction in Sleep Disorders: From Neurobiological Basis to Potential Therapeutic Approaches | Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/reader/f9d6a046ba7f1c5800768b8e4a0453774c18246f)]
	2. phasic; characterized by ponto-geniculo-occipital waves (originating in the [[brain stem]])^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep#Timing] + sympathetically driven phasic REM [[sleep]] is intermittently accompanied by rapid eye movements and cardiorespiratory fluctuations during the dream state^[[[PDF] Autonomic Dysfunction in Sleep Disorders: From Neurobiological Basis to Potential Therapeutic Approaches | Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/reader/f9d6a046ba7f1c5800768b8e4a0453774c18246f)]
2. the [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] balance shifts from [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] to [[sympathetic nervous system]|sympathetic] dominance when [[sleep]] enters the REM stage, and the [[heart rate]] and [[blood pressure]] increase abruptly^[[[PDF] Autonomic Dysfunction in Sleep Disorders: From Neurobiological Basis to Potential Therapeutic Approaches | Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/reader/f9d6a046ba7f1c5800768b8e4a0453774c18246f)]
	1. The firing rate of sympathetic neurons is reduced firing rate during [[non-rapid eye movement sleep|NREM sleep]], and their [[nerve conduction velocity|conduction velocity]] is reduced during tonic REM sleep. During phasic REM sleep, the firing rate increases along with an increase in [[norepinephrine]] release or greater reuptake inhibition.
