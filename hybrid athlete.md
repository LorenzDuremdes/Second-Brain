2. I'm reminded of all this whenever I scroll through social media posts of jacked guys running major mileage—and yes, it’s a little triggering. Because somehow, at least according to Instagram, there are a bunch of people who consistently run far and lift incredibly heavy.
   
   Scan through Bare’s content, and you’ll instantly know he trains. A lot. He’s posted about logging nearly 80-mile weeks running, yet he still has a superheroic chest and the sculpted arms and abs of a weight room junkie. Scroll through his YouTube feed and you'll see videos of his bodybuilding show prep. Scroll some more, and he’s prepping for an ultramarathon. It’s a non-stop cycle, and I’m almost tired just looking at it.^[https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a45712102/hybrid-athlete/]

		1. Absolutely insane. Gotta imagine the % of people in the world who can do both is like .00001% (~788). Arguably even .000001% (~78). Truly world class fitness man. Would love to even achieve being able to run a marathon in a good time + bench 315.
	2. [I was supposed to run Brazos Bend 100k last weekend, but it got cancelled... So I ran 32 miles in a 0.07mi cul-de-sac instead. : Ultramarathon (reddit.com)](https://new.reddit.com/r/Ultramarathon/comments/18domkk/i_was_supposed_to_run_brazos_bend_100k_last/)
		1. Way to take a shitty situation and make it much more miserable! Seriously, awesome job!
		2. Psycho behavior and I love it
		3. Being 30+ is when you have a long run scheduled that you need to wrap up before work, but also need to stay close enough to home to supervise your daughter, because your wife is out of town... So you run a full marathon around the cul-de-sac. ~400 laps!

1. I’m very, very skeptical that any of these guys are natural. I used to be a marathoner running 50 miles a week and I was fatigued all the time, my legs shrank despite continuing to lift hard. I just can’t see how guys like Nick Bare maintain that kind of [[muscle]] mass while running that much and that fast.
   
   Is it possible to run and lift concurrently? Absolutely. You can be good at both, you can’t be great at both concurrently.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/naturalbodybuilding/comments/1fzuoip/comment/lr4bx25/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]
2. There is zero science backing up a [[human]] carrying that much muscle and consistently running long distances without performance enhancing substances. Zero.
