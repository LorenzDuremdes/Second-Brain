1. hybrid athlete; someone who can run a marathon, has the physique of a bodybuilder, and has the strength of a powerlifter^[https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterAttia/comments/15gjz39/the_emergence_of_the_hybrid_athlete_peters_ideal/]
2. I'm reminded of all this whenever I scroll through social media posts of jacked guys running major mileage—and yes, it’s a little triggering. Because somehow, at least according to Instagram, there are a bunch of people who consistently run far and lift incredibly heavy.
   
   Scan through Bare’s content, and you’ll instantly know he trains. A lot. He’s posted about logging nearly 80-mile weeks running, yet he still has a superheroic chest and the sculpted arms and abs of a weight room junkie. Scroll through his YouTube feed and you'll see videos of his bodybuilding show prep. Scroll some more, and he’s prepping for an ultramarathon. It’s a non-stop cycle, and I’m almost tired just looking at it.^[https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a45712102/hybrid-athlete/]

	1. [I completed a 100 mile ultramarathon, and then bench pressed 405 only 3 days later!](https://new.reddit.com/r/GYM/comments/1alzzrm/i_completed_a_100_mile_ultramarathon_and_then/)
		1. Absolutely insane. Gotta imagine the % of people in the world who can do both is like .00001% (~788). Arguably even .000001% (~78). Truly world class fitness man. Would love to even achieve being able to run a marathon in a good time + bench 315.
	2. [I was supposed to run Brazos Bend 100k last weekend, but it got cancelled... So I ran 32 miles in a 0.07mi cul-de-sac instead. : Ultramarathon (reddit.com)](https://new.reddit.com/r/Ultramarathon/comments/18domkk/i_was_supposed_to_run_brazos_bend_100k_last/)
		1. Way to take a shitty situation and make it much more miserable! Seriously, awesome job!
		2. Psycho behavior and I love it
		3. Being 30+ is when you have a long run scheduled that you need to wrap up before work, but also need to stay close enough to home to supervise your daughter, because your wife is out of town... So you run a full marathon around the cul-de-sac. ~400 laps!

	4. On Instagram you can see him routinely chalking off a 60km ultra and deadlifting the Dinnie Stones, or powerlifting a combined 600kg and chalking off an Olympic triathlon. Often on the same day, just hours apart.
