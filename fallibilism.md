1. fallibilism; the philosophical claim that no belief can have justification which guarantees the truth of the belief, or that no beliefs are certain.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallibilism#cite_note-2]
	1. fallibilists typically accept that many beliefs can be considered certain beyond reasonable doubt and therefore acted upon, allowing us to live functional and meaningful lives
	2. plausible candidates for **infallible beliefs** include beliefs about logical truths ("Either Jones is a Democrat or Jones is not a Democrat"), beliefs about immediate appearances ("It **seems** that I see a patch of blue"), and incorrigible beliefs (i.e., beliefs that are true in virtue of being believed, such as Descartes' "I think, therefore I am"). Many others, however, have taken even these types of beliefs to be fallible.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallibilism#cite_note-15]
