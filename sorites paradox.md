1. sorites paradox; Under the assumption that removing a single grain does not turn a heap into a non-heap, the paradox is to consider what happens when the process is repeated enough times: is a single remaining grain still a heap? If not, when did it change from a heap to a non-heap?^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox#cite_note-Sorensen2009-3]
2. The sorites paradox: If a heap is reduced by a single grain at a time, at what exact point does it cease to be considered a heap?^[By Simon A. Eugster - Own work, CC BY 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=7785261]
