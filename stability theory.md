1. stability theory; addresses the stability of solutions of [[differential equation|differential equations]] and of trajectories of [[dynamical system theory|dynamical systems]] under small perturbations of initial conditions
	1. differential equations → change
	2. why "small"?
2. **Stability diagram classifying Poincaré maps as stable or unstable according to their features. Stability generally increases to the left of the diagram.**^[By Freesodas - Gimp, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=67990034]

3. is a stable state always *functional* + why? + example
	1. no e.g. obesity^[The science of [[trust]]: emotional attunement for couples, p. 445]

1. (in)stability → {long/short}-term
