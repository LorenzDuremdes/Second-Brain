### unstable
1. Repeatedly choosing unsuitable partners may not be a sign of one’s misfortune. We’re more likely to be making the same mistakes on purpose — because, **secretly, we believe we’re *unworthy* of love**.^[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfsTJnpRxeg]
	1. e.g. mean people being closer to your own [[self]]-reflection (e.g. "'I am dismissive of myself and so is he' ↮ 'Why does he like me so much, what's so likeable about me?'"
2. “Unhealthy love is based on two people trying to escape their problems through their emotions for each other—in other words, they’re using each other as an escape. Healthy love is based on two people acknowledging and addressing their own problems with each other’s support.” -Mark Manson
	1. needing ↮ wanting each other (respectively)
	2. dependence ↮ interdependence (respectively)

	1. yes e.g. too young (e.g. lack of effective [[communication]], which can be learned)

		of course. thats happen a good few times. one of my ex's that i still love dearly and have for many many years dropped this line when we were breaking up that i still remember. "I think we meet each other to young". that will always get me.
	2. **other**
		1. [Bout 5 years later we caught up and things rekindled... By then he was the right guy right [[time]] and here we are 3 years later. + other comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/pvgqp2/why_do_you_believe_in_right_person_wrong_time/)
		2. But I really wasn’t ready for everything I knew the relationship would need (like commitment and [[communication]], sharing my feels) and he wasn’t either, but to a lesser extent. so we broke up.

			When the timing was “right”, we just reconnected after not talking for awhile and now we’re married and happy af.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/gc8oyl/comment/fpa30om/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]

### [[men]] ↮ [[women]]
1. it's usually harder for [[women]] to be single

# [[developmental psychology]]
## 'chemistry (love)' doesn't have to be present in the beginning
1. e.g. it fluctuates over [[time]]^[https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/8kxhvn/comment/dzbcblg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]^[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1ksle6/comment/cbs9y9s/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
2. I fell for someone I didn’t have initial chemistry with and almost rejected. I’ve come to the conclusion that first date “sparks” are overrated.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/hv7a84/i_fell_for_someone_i_didnt_have_initial_chemistry/]
	1. When people talk about things like 'Chemistry' and 'Sparks' all I hear is "Magic Sparkles". I'm convinced it's 100% the territory of disney and rom-com bullshit.
3. she should have continued to date them to see if they were good relationship material and MAKE her own chemistry^[https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereAreAllTheGoodMen/comments/r0lv4b/comment/hltk2da/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
