1. relaxation (approximation); an approximation of a difficult problem by a nearby problem that is easier to solve^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_(approximation)]

# [[minimum spanning tree]]
1. "relaxation (approximation) · [[minimum spanning tree]]" can never be any longer than the real solution^[Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions, p. 185]

## applicabilities
1. setting the lower bound threshold one can try to work toward ([[global optimum]]) ones reintroducing certain variables^[Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions, p. 185]
	1. If we calculate that the spanning tree distance for a particular set of towns is 100 miles, we can be sure the traveling salesman distance will be no less than that. And if we find, say, a 110-mile route, we can be certain it is at most 10% longer than the best solution. Thus we can get a grasp of how close we are to the real answer even without knowing what it is.
