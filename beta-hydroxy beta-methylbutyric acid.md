# mechanism
## positive
1. is HMB scientifically proven to be [[performance-enhancing substance|performance enhancing]]?
	1. In healthy adults, supplementation with HMB has been shown to increase exercise-induced gains in muscle size, muscle strength, and lean body mass, reduce [[skeletal muscle]] damage from exercise, improve aerobic exercise performance, and expedite [[post-exercise recovery|recovery from exercise]].^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-Hydroxy_beta-methylbutyric_acid#cite_note-Enhancing_performance-13]
4. main function^[https://examine.com/supplements/hmb/]
	1. anti-catabolic
	2. less effective than [[leucine]] in inducing MPS
5. HMB → ventilatory threshold^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5537867/]
	1. HMB increases ventilatory threshold
	2. as well as anaerobic peak power
## negative
1. does HMB reduce [[muscle hypertrophy|hypertrophy]] (by possibly reducing [[inflammation]]) like [[cryotherapy]]?
# how to take
1. optimal time of ingestion
	1. the greatest reduction in skeletal muscle damage from a single bout of exercise has been shown to occur when HMB-Ca is ingested 1–2 hours prior to exercise or HMB-FA is ingested 30–60 minutes prior to exercise^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-Hydroxy_beta-methylbutyric_acid#cite_note-ISSN_position_stand_2013-1]
		1. HMB is said to be 20-fold more potent than [[leucine]] for this purpose (anti-catabolic)^[https://examine.com/supplements/hmb/]
2. dosage
	1. 1–3 grams daily^[https://examine.com/supplements/hmb/]
3. can you ingest HMB out of capsule?
