1. One area where connectionist models are thought to be biologically implausible is with respect to error-propagation networks that are needed to support learning^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism#cite_ref-11]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism#cite_note-:4-12]
	1. ...but error propagation can explain some of the biologically-generated electrical activity seen at the scalp in event-related potentials such as the N400 and P600,^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism#cite_note-13] and this provides some biological support for one of the key assumptions of connectionist learning procedures.
	2. why do "error-propagation networks" support learning? (necessary vs. optional?) â†’ e.g. avoiding "underfitting/[[overfitting]]?"
