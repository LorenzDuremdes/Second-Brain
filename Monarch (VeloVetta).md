	1. O’Malley, who is an engineer with experience working on the International space station and hydrogen fueled engines, says he noticed people taking whatever shoes they had to the wind tunnel just to see which were the most aero, and decided he could make something that was intentionally, rather than accidentally, aerodynamic.
   
   “Athletes spend a lot of time trying to figure out which shoe is aerodynamically the fastest,” O’Malley said, “but no one had made a serious analytical effort at designing one. The Monarch is the first shoe designed using the same technology and techniques as bike frames, helmets, and yes, aircraft.”
3. Both VeloVetta and Giro Empire shoes tested faster than my Bont Zero+ shoes that I'd used for years because they were so aero. Tough to nail down the exact CdA difference as it was across difference days and lots of back and forth between the 3 shoes. VeloVettas and Giro Empire (laces tucked in, no aero covers) reduced CdA by 0.001-0.002 over Bonts. Only a handful of watts separating them depending on what [[speed]] you're riding at, but those are all super proven aero shoes.^[https://forum.slowtwitch.com/forum/Slowtwitch_Forums_C1/Triathlon_Forum_F1/VeloVetta_Monarch_aero_cycling_shoe_review_P8009345/]
