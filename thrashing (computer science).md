1. thrashing ([[computer science]]); occurs when a computer's virtual [[computer data storage|memory]] resources are overused, leading to a constant state of paging and page faults, inhibiting most application-level processing.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_(computer_science)#cite_note-1]
	1. usually happens [[nonlinear system|nonlinearly]] (criticality) e.g. when juggling one ball too many, you tend to drop _all_ of them^[Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions, p. 129]
2. how could "thrashing (computer science)" be prevented?
	1. more RAM^[Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions, p. 131]
		1. difficult to do with human brains, but can be done via e.g. extended minds ([[cache hierarchy|cache hierarchies]])
	2. refusing new tasks when exceeding RAM (human terms: saying "no")
3. the [[computational complexity]] can increase exponentially due to "thrashing (computer science)"
	1. an inbox that’s three times as full as usual could take you nine times as long to process → scanning through those emails means swapping every message into your mind, one after another, before you respond to any of them: a surefire recipe for memory thrashing^[Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions, p. 131]
