1. phase response curve; illustrates the transient change (phase response) in the cycle period of an oscillation induced by a perturbation as a function of the phase at which it is received
2. PRCs are used in various fields; examples of biological oscillations are the heartbeat, circadian rhythms, and the regular, repetitive firing observed in some neurons in the absence of [[noise]].
3. Phase response curves for light and for melatonin administration (picture)

1. is "[[phase space]]" related to "phase response curve"? + why
	1. could be, because a PRC shows all the possible states of a system, ≤4-dimensional
	2. 5-dimensional → not related
2. [[Granger causality]] → e.g. the curve of "melatonin" and its history predicts the future of "[[sleep]] pressure" more than the history of "[[sleep]] pressure" itself does to its future
3. [[functional connectivity]] → deviation from statistical independence + temporal correlation
