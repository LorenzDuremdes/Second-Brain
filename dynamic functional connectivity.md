1. dynamic [[functional connectivity]]; refers to the observed phenomenon that [[functional connectivity]] changes over a short [[time]]
2. Dynamic [[functional connectivity]] is a recent expansion on traditional [[functional connectivity]] analysis which typically assumes that functional networks are static in [[time]].
3. The default mode network above is one example of a [[brain]] network seen using [[steady state]] connectivity. This network is fairly stable in [[time]], but it has been shown to have a variable relationship with other networks, and to vary slightly in its own characteristics in [[time]].^[By John Graner, Neuroimaging Department, National Intrepid Center of Excellence, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, 8901 Wisconsin Avenue, Bethesda, MD 20889, USA. - http://www.frontiersin.org/Neurotrauma/10.3389/fneur.2013.00016/full, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=25872800]

# [[optimization]]
1. how could it be more efficient to see something as belonging to "one concept" when e.g. latency is low enough?
	1. being aware of distinctions, themselves, might require more [[synaptic updates per second|neural resources]]?
	2. when latency is lower, the SUPS also have to be higher (usually), which requires _even more_ neural resources
