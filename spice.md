1. spice intensity â†’ adding spices during vs. after cooking
	1. the longer you cook it, the more it infuses and blends in with the other ingredients. Things like rosemary that are pretty aggressive should be added early on to smooth out the flavor. I don't want bites of rosemary, I just want a hint of that flavor throughout. Something like sumac which I add for the bright pop of flavor can be sprinkled right on the finished dish.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/u7agjt/question_for_those_in_the_know_when_to_add_spices/]
	2. **personal**: during also gives off a smell (which is part of the whole eating process)
