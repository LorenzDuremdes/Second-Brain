1. how much sugar can you fit per liter while keeping it a [[liquid]]?
	1. ~1:2 ratio at room temperature (e.g. 200 g of sugar per 100 mL [[water]])^[GPT-4]
	2. **personal preference**: 2:1 ratio with [[sucrose]] and boiling [[water]] + shaking
		1. first hour can usually be covered through pre-race nutrition
			2. pure [[sucrose]] in small bottle with [[water]] to be added later on
2. After accounting for catheter dead space and assay noise, the mean [[time]] lag of tracer appearance in the interstitial space was 5.3–6.2 min. We conclude that in the **overnight fasted** state in healthy adults, the physiological delay of [[glucose]] transport from the vascular to the interstitial space is 5–6 min.^[[Time Lag of Glucose From Intravascular to Interstitial Compartment in Humans | Diabetes | American Diabetes Association (diabetesjournals.org)](https://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article/62/12/4083/33941/Time-Lag-of-Glucose-From-Intravascular-to)]
