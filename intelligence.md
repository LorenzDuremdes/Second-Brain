1. heavy weighing factors causing external [[information]] (not stored in one's long-term [[human memory]]) to not contribute much to one's intelligence
	1. high latency
	2. less quantity of [[information]] (e.g. [[brain]] makes from "A" and "B" → "AB")
3. do you have to know beforehand why you want to ask something? + why
	1. not necessarily → sometimes just increasing the quantity/accuracy of manipulable [[information]] is enough → increase future freedom of action
		1. e.g. you don't know (everything) either what you can do with the knowledge you acquire (in [[spaced repetition|SRS]])
4. intelligence → gravity
	1. intelligence is like gravity: it emanates from its point(s) of influence and (usually) becomes weaker farther away from them
		1. analogous to extended mind thesis
			1. interference1=[[gravitational potential energy]] → why (not)?
5. intelligence → [[entropy]]
	1. higher intelligence decreases local entropy more quickly/efficiently
	2. **see**: intelligence formula
# high intelligence
1. high intelligence → "simple" questions are complicated
	1. This is why high+ gifted people often seem so out of sync with those around them. The question “how are you today?” can feel extremely complex (How am I about which aspect of my life? Why are you asking? How should I be? and so on)
2. positive correlation between [[emotion|emotional]] intensity and intelligence (especially in girls)?
	1. e.g. ProjektMelody, Hanna Freriks, yourself, Anne-Lynn de Kock
	2. better [[neurophysiology|hardware]] → increases intensity of all?
