1. maximum recoverable volume; the highest volume of training an athlete can do in a particular microcycle (or any chosen timescale e.g. session) and still recover to present a full overload in the next microcycle^[How Much Should I Train by Dr. Mike Israetel and Dr. James Hoffmann, p. 9]
	1. session → e.g. MRV is estimated to be maximum 12 sets per muscle group per session
2. what happens when you consistently train _at_ MRV?^[How Much Should I Train by Dr. Mike Israetel and Dr. James Hoffmann, p. 44]
	1. your body spends all its resources on recovering rather than adaptation

# [[progressive overload|overload]] + [[work capacity (sports science)]]
1. "overload ([[sports science]])" is a % of "[[work capacity (sports science)]]" is a % of "MRV"^[How Much Should I Train by Dr. Mike Israetel and Dr. James Hoffmann, p. 17]

## [[progressive overload|overload]]
1. "overload" and "MRV" are closely connected^[How Much Should I Train by Dr. Mike Israetel and Dr. James Hoffmann, p. 21]

# [[skeletal muscle]]
1. muscle fiber type → MRV^[How Much Should I Train by Dr. Mike Israetel and Dr. James Hoffmann, p. 15]
	1. fast-twitch predominant people recover slower, but also gain more fitness for the same relative load
2. stretch under load capacity of a muscle → fatigue^[How Much Should I Train by Dr. Mike Israetel and Dr. James Hoffmann, p. 15]
	1. the more stretch under load a muscle is physically capable of undergoing, the more fatigue the muscle can accumulate
		1. e.g. side delts have lower stretch under load capacity than hamstrings (and former therefore usually has a higher MRV)
		2. cross sectional area and fiber length also play roles here
3. height → MRV^[How Much Should I Train by Dr. Mike Israetel and Dr. James Hoffmann, p. 15]
	1. taller people usually have lower MRVs due to a bigger ROM

## [[fast-twitch muscle fibers type II]]


# training experience
1. what can you do when overload volume exceeds MRV (elite)?^[How Much Should I Train by Dr. Mike Israetel and Dr. James Hoffmann, p. 25]
	1. you have to increase intensity and other things e.g. metabolite training or BFR

# types of training
## speed work
1. speed work → fatigue (MRV)^[How Much Should I Train by Dr. Mike Israetel and Dr. James Hoffmann , p. 26–27]
	1. speed work is quite fatiguing in itself

## [[endurance training]]
1. [[endurance training]] → fatigue (MRV)^[How Much Should I Train by Dr. Mike Israetel and Dr. James Hoffmann, p. 28]
	1. [[endurance training]] usually has a very high MRV e.g. due to not being as fatiguing, excellent blood perfusion, slower-twitch muscle fibers, smaller muscle size...

# [[men]] ↮ [[women]]
1. [[women]] usually have higher MRVs due to being shorter, producing less force, and inter alia don't take as much homeostatic damage from training^[How Much Should I Train by Dr. Mike Israetel and Dr. James Hoffmann, p. 16]

# hypotheses
1. tendons → MRV
	1. tendons have a higher short-term MRV and lower long-term MRV compared to [[skeletal muscle]]?
