1. maximum recoverable volume; the highest volume of training an athlete can do in a particular microcycle (or any chosen timescale e.g. session) and still recover to present a full overload in the next microcycle^[How Much Should I Train by Dr. Mike Israetel and Dr. James Hoffmann, p. 9]
	1. session → e.g. MRV is estimated to be maximum 12 sets per muscle group per session

# [[skeletal muscle]]
1. muscle fiber type → MRV^[How Much Should I Train by Dr. Mike Israetel and Dr. James Hoffmann, p. 15]
	1. fast-twitch predominant people recover slower, but also gain more fitness for the same relative load
2. stretch under load capacity of a muscle → fatigue^[How Much Should I Train by Dr. Mike Israetel and Dr. James Hoffmann, p. 15]
	1. the more stretch under load a muscle is physically capable of undergoing, the more fatigue the muscle can accumulate
		1. e.g. side delts have lower stretch under load capacity than hamstrings (and former therefore usually has a higher MRV)
		2. cross sectional area and fiber length also play roles here
