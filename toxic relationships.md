1. I had amazing ex boyfriend who was everything I could wish for, but there was no butterflies
   
   Since I broke it off with him I havenâ€™t met man even comparable to him. I wish I could go back and tell my 20 years old self that later on I will mature and appreciate different things in life than stupid butterflies in stomach.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/x79v55/comment/ind4hq8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
2. why could [[sexual intercourse]] be 'better' with toxic partners?
	1. The best sex I have ever had was with someone who I had very little connection with outside the bedroom.

		It was not enough to sustain a relationship.

		I think it becomes intoxicating because it's the closest you ever get to the person. You crave intimacy with them and sex is the only time you get it so it becomes so much more amazing

		  Kinda how everything tastes amazing when you're starving.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rm5pgu/comment/hpk5cut/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
