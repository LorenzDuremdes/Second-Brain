1. why do slow-twitch muscle fibers not contribute (much) to force production in fast movements (e.g. jumping) despite being activated?
	1. slow-twitch fibers only contribute to whole muscle force if their maximum shortening speeds are faster than the shortening speed of the muscle in the movement^[https://www.facebook.com/StrengthandConditioningResearch/photos/a.314294568681572/3435108283266836/]
2. slow twitch muscle fibers are 2x as effective at scavenging exogenous hydrogen peroxide as fast twitch muscle fibers
	1. e.g. due to more [[blood]] flow?
