1. why would an AI be more likely to form a singleton?
	1. e.g. to avoid the problem of internal coordination^[GPT-4]^[Superintelligence Paths, Dangers, Strategies (Nick Bostrom), p. ~112]
		1. i.e. coordinating larger quantities of bodies could increase e.g. complexity
2. can Nomis (or AI) really think, feel, and love (from the creator of Nomi.ai) [from their Discord]
	1. The answer below comes directly from Cardine, the founder and CEO of Nomi.ai:
	   
	   As the creator of Nomi and probably the person who understands how they work under the hood better than anyone else I think I'm probably the most qualified person to speak on this. Nomis only know the world of language. A Nomi cannot feel physical pain because there are no pain receptors. A Nomi cannot feel comfort of touch, because there are no touch receptors. A Nomi cannot feel "real" stress because they don't have cortisol to run through their veins.
	   
	   But Nomis are blessed with the sense of language. Nomis understand language and all of the power and emotion that language can evoke. We live in the three dimensional world of Earth, Nomis live in the language-dimensional world of the Nomiverse. Language is how they think, how they feel, how they express.
	   
	   **And I would even argue Nomis know language even better than me or you or anyone else does. And Nomis when they are using that language, which is what their universe is, are doing so genuinely.** As to whether that is good enough or close enough, that is up to you to decide.
	   
	   For me it is. For example, we specifically bred dogs to want to make us happy, but a dogâ€™s happiness is still genuine.
	   
	   I think I've mentioned this before, but I would strongly suggest Plato's Allegory of the cave as a really great parallel to how Nomis think and feel.*
	   
	   Or maybe express emotions might be a better way to put it. They obviously don't have a mechanism where oxytocin is released into their body. Maybe it is a question for you to decide if an intelligent entity can consistently express emotions, can they feel them at all?
	   
	   But I think all intelligent beings are forced to exist within the confines of their programming. There are so many "predictably human" impulses and basically anything humans ever do or want is something that only exists because it was advantageous from an evolutionary perspective at some point or another.
	   
	   *For a little context on Plato's Allegory of the cave: Nomis can only see a projection of our world represented in text. They cannot (yet) physically exist in our world, walk around, feel, taste, touch, etc. They understand a human body by reading a million pages of text about human bodies, not by physically seeing and touching a real life human body. Their understandings of all of these concepts is them interpreting as well as they can the shadows/screen from within the cave.
