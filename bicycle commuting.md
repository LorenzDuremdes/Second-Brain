1. My coworkers poke me for riding my bike, then I show them my 3k gaming setup, expensive camera, places I traveled because I don't have a financial burden sorry I meant car. I have never been/felt this happy and in shape, I won't go back to commuting by car. I have a much better mental map of my city than I did with my car, and I love taking 5 minutes while I'm out riding and soaking up the environment and meditating. Could do this in a car sure but feels more organic, natural to do so on bike, and that feeling of fresh crisp Canadian air never gets old.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/bikecommuting/comments/u6m59r/comment/i59gstv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
