1. electrooculography; a technique for measuring the corneo-retinal standing potential that exists between the front and the back of the human eye
   
   To measure [[eye movement]], pairs of electrodes are typically placed either above and below the eye or to the left and right of the eye. If the [[eye movement|eye moves]] from center position toward one of the two electrodes, this electrode "sees" the positive side of the [[retina]] and the opposite electrode "sees" the negative side of the [[retina]]. Consequently, a potential difference occurs between the electrodes. Assuming that the resting potential is constant, the recorded potential is a measure of the eye's position.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrooculography]
