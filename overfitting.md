1. overfitting → stability^[Algorithms to Live By: The [[Computer Science]] of Human Decisions, p. 166]
	1. overfitted data are usually very unstable while one- and two-factor models would remain more or less steady during variations

# problem solving
1. what could help against "overfitting"? + how^[Algorithms to Live By: The [[Computer Science]] of Human Decisions, p. 171]
	1. [[cross-validation (statistics)]], by comparing the accounted factors used to estimate with the actual values
		1. e.g. sometimes 2 factors produces the closest results to the actual values, and if not, try ¬2
2. **[[construal level theory]]** → overfitting
	1. a too low level-construal can cause overfitting
