1. overfitting → stability^[Algorithms to Live By: The [[Computer Science]] of Human Decisions, p. 166]
	1. overfitted data are usually very unstable while one- and two-factor models would remain more or less steady during variations
2. [[ecological validity]] → overfitting
	1. the higher the [[ecological validity]], the lower the overfitting

# problem solving
1. what could help against "overfitting"? + how^[Algorithms to Live By: The [[Computer Science]] of Human Decisions, p. 171]
	1. [[cross-validation (statistics)]], by comparing the accounted factors used to estimate with the actual values
		1. e.g. sometimes 2 factors produces the closest results to the actual values, and if not, try ¬2
2. **[[construal level theory]]** → overfitting
	1. a too low level-construal can cause overfitting
		1. **see also**: Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions, p. 173
3. **[[learning rate]]** → overfitting
	1. a lower [[learning rate]] could potentially prevent overfitting^[Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions, p. 174]
		1. e.g. having to prioritize and learn high-level construals first

# things that can increase [[probability]] of overfitting
1. uncertainty → overfitting^[Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions, p. 178]
	1. the greater the uncertainty, the more sensitive you could be to overfitting e.g. factorizing (semi-)incorrect variables

# examples
1. how does "[[evolution]]" prevent "overfitting"?^[Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions, p. 176]
	1. being constrained by the past makes us less perfectly adjusted to the present we know but helps keep us robust for the future we don’t
