# preventing gluten
1. [[sugar]] and [[acid|acids]] such as [[buttermilk]] or [[yogurt]] also discourage gluten from developing, so adding them early on will tenderize [[pastry|pastries]].
   
   Too much [[fat]] can also inhibit gluten networks from forming. By coating individual gluten strands, fat prevents them from sticking to one another and lengthening. This is where the term shortening comes from, because the gluten strands remain short instead of lengthening.
   
   [[p√¢tisserie|Pastry]] chefs generally seek tender, flaky, and moist textures, so they do everything they can to limit or control gluten development, including using low [[protein]] [[flour|flours]] and avoiding overkneading.^[Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking (Samin Nosrat), p. 126]
