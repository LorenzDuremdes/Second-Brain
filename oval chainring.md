1. equivalent round chainring conversion formula (oval chainring) = ovality/(200 + ovality) · no. of teeth^[[Chris Bell - Oval EGGring Notes - page 2 (cornant.uk)](https://www.cornant.uk/info/ovals02.html)]
	1. so, for example, a 42t chainring with 10% ovality feels like a 44t ring during the power-stroke and a 40t ring at the dead-spots  (ie. add or subtract (10/210x42) teeth)
