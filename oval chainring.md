1. equivalent round chainring conversion formula (oval chainring) = ovality/(200 + ovality) · no. of teeth^[[Chris Bell - Oval EGGring Notes - page 2 (cornant.uk)](https://www.cornant.uk/info/ovals02.html)]
	1. so, for example, a 42t chainring with 10% ovality feels like a 44t ring during the power-stroke and a 40t ring at the dead-spots  (ie. add or subtract (10/210x42) teeth)

# research
1. peak and mean power values are consistently higher (4 to 9 percent) than normal cranks during an anaerobic test (e.g. Wingate test)
	1. Statistically, significant differences were observed with position 4 (134-degree angle) and somewhat with position 3 (128 degrees). More than two-thirds (68 percent) of the subjects achieved the highest power values with position 4, and one-quarter of the subjects achieved the highest values with position 3.
	   
	   The proposed explanations for why the Rotor system worked best on the anaerobic test come from the biomechanical requirements that go along with high power outputs. The greater leverage (because of the longer effective crankarm length with the Rotor design), combined with the lower negative momentum during the upstroke (because of the shorter effective crankarm length in this phase), may come into play _only at these high power outputs_.^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, 230]
