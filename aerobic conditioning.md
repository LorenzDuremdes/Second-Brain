1. how often should you do conditioning?
	1. during recovery week (for variety and MV of cycling endurance as well)
	2. 1x per week for MV (and >2x to make progress) when doing this solely (or based on TSS when not cycling)
	- the conditioning mimics cycling positions and the latter probably maintains the gains from conditioning and vice versa (including progress) → RT (with an aim for [[anaerobic capacity]]) is usually  a higher priority instead
	- conditioning can also allow you to stay at Z5 for much longer (e.g. instead of legs giving up, you can continue with upper body)

# conditioning circuit
1. conditioning circuit; a combination of several exercises performed with no rest in between, or as little rest as possible^[https://vitruve.fit/blog/conditioning-circuit-for-high-performance-athletes/]

## personal
1. **circuit 1 (push)**
	1. clean & jerk for whole body (especially shoulders and triceps) Z6
	2. followed by chest (and triceps) e.g. push-ups (own bodyweight makes sense → external validity for cycling) Z6
		1. chest closer to sleds as they are stronger
	3. sleds Z5 (continuing mainly push muscles)
2. **circuit 2 (pull)**
	1. kettlebell swings (mostly lower back) Z6
	2. kettlebell holds (continuing mostly lower back), alternating higher (biceps)/lower holds Z5 (rows don't engage lower back and abs as much hence different than circuit 1 i.e. Z6 exercise)
	3. rows to finish of total body with mostly lower back and abs Z5
4. **optional finisher:** air bike, mostly whole body and try to engage upper body a lot as well (probably more as you train your legs enough during cycling) Z5
5. Z6 for [[anaerobic capacity]]
6. Z5 for e.g. [[lactate shuttle hypothesis|lactate shuttling]], [[skeletal muscle perfusion]]
7. with upper-body BFR
