1. [[melatonin]] · [[magnesium]] · [[zinc]] supplementation → primary [[insomnia]]
	1. In another double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, the authors evaluated the effect of a triple supplementation of melatonin, magnesium and zinc on 43 residents of a long-term care facility in Italy who exhibited primary insomnia. Patients ingested daily a combination of melatonin (5 mg), magnesium (225 mg) and zinc (11.25 mg) mixed in 100 g of pear pulp for 60 days, one hour before bedtime. Patients that received this mineral supplement exhibited a remarkable improvement of [[sleep quality]] with a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index reduced from 12.7 ± 2.6 to 5.5 ± 1.9. On the other hand, placebo-treated patients did not show any sleep quality improvement (12.3 ± 3.6 and 12.0 ± 4.4, respectively, before and after placebo treatment).^[[Dietary Zinc Acts as a Sleep Modulator - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5713303/)]
