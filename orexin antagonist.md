1. [[orexin]] antagonist; a [[drug]] that inhibits the effect of [[orexin]] by acting as a receptor antagonist of one (selective [[orexin]] receptor antagonist or SORA) or both (dual [[orexin]] receptor antagonis or DORA) of the [[orexin]] receptors, OX1 and OX2. Medical applications include treatment of [[dyssomnia|sleep disorders]] such as [[insomnia]].
   
   [[Orexin]] receptor antagonists dose-dependently improve [[sleep]] parameters including latency to persistent [[sleep]] (LPS), [[wake after sleep onset]] (WASO), [[sleep efficiency]] (SE), [[total sleep time]] (TST), and [[sleep quality]] (SQ).
   
   [[Orexin]] receptor antagonists are not currently used as first-line treatments for [[insomnia]] due to cost and concerns about possible misuse liability.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orexin_antagonist]
