1. implying a max vo2 at least in the high 60s. The number of 20 year olds than can do that is maybe 1 in 10000. The number of 50 year olds?

	Among the general population? Sure. 

	But you’re not racing the general population. You are racing people who are so into biking that they ride their bikes inside. And that are at the pointy end of that population. 

	So yeah, it does not surprise me that many people doing A-races on Zwift have VO2s in the 60-70+ range. 

	Heck, I can name 10 local guys (myself included) who are in their mid-30s or older with VO2s in that range.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/1bajn2l/comment/ku35q9f/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]
2. I know a 60yo who cruises +500km each week and regularly drops guys at club rides lol they definitely exist.

	Of course he's a retired dentist, though.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/1bajn2l/comment/ku2zgvz/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]
