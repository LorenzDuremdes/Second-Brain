1. Another example from that period is IBM's _TCP/IP Tutorial and Technical Overview_ from 1989 (updated in 1998), which stated that:
   
> The word _internet_ (also _internetwork_) is simply a contraction of the phrase _interconnected network_. However, when written with a capital "I", the Internet refers to the worldwide set of interconnected networks. Hence, the Internet is an internet, but the reverse does not apply. The Internet is sometimes called the _connected Internet_.

[[Capitalization]] of the word as an adjective (specifically, a noun adjunct) also varies. Some guides specify that the word should be capitalized as a noun but not capitalized as an adjective, e.g., "internet resources."^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalization_of_Internet]
