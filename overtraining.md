1. OTS occurred independently from excessive training, since insufficient calorie, [[protein]], or [[carbohydrate]] intake, poor [[sleep quality]], or concurrent excessive cognitive effort were the found to be prevailing predictors of OTS.^[[Novel insights of overtraining syndrome discovered from the EROS study - PMC (nih.gov)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6590962/#s5)]

2. true overtraining is uncommon^[Dr. Andrew Coggan: https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/endurance-rides-feel-absolutely-useless/89127/238?u=lorenz_duremdes]
3. is overtraining a continuum? + why
	1. debate continues about whether the process of overtraining is a continuum or a series of distinct and independent phase
	2. having standardized definitions as a basis of discussion is helpful (these are outlined inmore detail in the interview with Dr. Romain Meeusen on page 110).^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 131]
