1. exercise-associated muscle cramps; defined as cramping (painful muscle spasms) during or immediately following exercise.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise-associated_muscle_cramps#cite_note-r1-1]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise-associated_muscle_cramps#cite_note-r2-2]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise-associated_muscle_cramps#cite_note-r3-3]

# [[physiology]]

# neuromuscular
1. Muscle overload and fatigue affects the balance between the excitatory drive from muscle spindles and the inhibitory drive from the Golgi tendon organs (GTO). This results in a localized muscle cramp.^[[Exercise-Associated Muscle Cramp- Doubts About the Cause](https://www.semanticscholar.org/reader/a76d5d128eb14a202adaac22e336f35b4c8805fd)]
## causes
1. Though methodologies were limited, many of the observations were remarkably prescient. For example, Moss (1923) published an extensive report in which he documented cases of cramp among coal miners and the factors that may have contributed to the development of these cramps. He attributed the onset of cramps, which in some cases were seriously debilitating, to^[[EXERCISE-ASSOCIATED MUSCLE CRAMP, Gatorade Sports Science Institute](https://www.gssiweb.org/docs/default-source/sse-docs/maughan_sse_200_final.pdf?sfvrsn=2)]:
	1) High air temperatures
	2) Excessive drinking of [[water]] caused by dryness of the mouth and throat
	3) Continued hard work
2. It is also not correct to say that there have been no large-scale prospective studies to assess the role of [[water]] and salt balance in the etiology of muscle cramps. Dill et al. (1936) reported the findings of intervention studies carried out at the construction site of the Hoover Dam and in the steel mills of Youngstown, Ohio. At both locations, large numbers of men undertook hard physical work in extremely hot environments on a daily basis. They found that those suffering from cramp displayed the following characteristics:
	1) [[Dehydration]]
	2) Lowered concentration of [[sodium]] and chloride in [[blood plasma]]
	3) Little or no [[sodium]] or chloride in urine
	4) Increased serum [[protein]] concentration
	5) Increased [[red blood cell|red cell]] count
	6) Normal osmotic pressure

# technology
1. with the help of this **wearable device, muscle cramps occurring at upper limbs can be detected** and further injuries, complications can be reduced. The proposed muscular vest also initiates early detection of muscle cramps, thereby avoiding the risk of fractures and injuries.^[[Early Detection of Exercise - Associated Muscle cramp](https://ymerdigital.com/uploads/YMER210112.pdf)]
	1. EMG signals which are obtained from adhesive electrodes are amplified by using IC741 (op-amp) with instrumentation amplifier configuration. LM35 temperature sensor is used to monitor the temperature at specified locations. Wherever the cramp occurring possibilities are high. Flex sensor is used to identify the abnormal contraction and relaxation muscles in upper limbs. The three input bio potential signals are fed to the micro controller (Arduino UNO). The main objective of this system is to provide a comfortable vest which would monitor the cramps occurring in athletes whenever it occurs. Therefore with the help of this wearable device muscle cramps occurring at upper limbs can be detected and further injuries, complications such as fractures can be reduced.
