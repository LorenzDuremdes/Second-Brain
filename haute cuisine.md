# good qualities
1. *"Good cooks know how. Great cooks know why."* ―Serious Eats (founded by cef J. Kenji Lopez-Alt author of The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science)
2. I was going to say seasoning for sure, I remember Casey Thompson saying the difference between a great dish and a dish that can send you packing can literally come down to a flake of salt.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/TopChef/comments/16m1rsz/best_advice_from_top_chef/]
3. how should you cook vegetables professionally?
	1. Don't boil. Nothing ruins a veggie faster than boiling.
	   
	   If you want moist veggies, steam them. Then you can sprinkle them with a seasoning, or sautee them with some garlic or ginger and s&p. Butter will make them delicious but less healthy, olive oil for more healthy but less delicious.
	   
	   If you want them dry, roast them. Broccoli, carrots, cabbage, beets, cauliflower, and a lot more taste great roasted. Just google a recipe for whichever veg you have. Or put a bunch on a sheet pan and roast them together. I often do a sheet pan dinner with sausages, brussels, carrots and onions, and toss it with a little honey mustard at the end.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/1enea76/how_do_i_cook_veggies_the_healthy_way/]
