# [[evolutionary psychology]]
1. what could be a possible [[evolution|evolutionary]] reason why young [[women]] are more desperate than [[men]]?
	1. their attractiveness is mostly based on physical appearance, which lowers as one ages
	2. [[men]]'s attractiveness are more based on success, which usually increases as one ages
2. what could be an evolutionary reason why [[women]] care more about [[personality]] and [[men]] about physical appearance?
	1. ◇it takes more time to get to know the other (which could have been used to spread your genes as a male)

## miscellaneous
1. art as a fitness indicator; superior execution of art was evolutionarily important because it attracted mates^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art#cite_note-Dutton-92]

# breakup
1. A 2020 study reported that [[women]] tend to find a man more attractive if the man's previous relationships ended mutually, and less attractive if the man was dumped.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection_in_humans#cite_note-38]

# biopsychology
1. traits · [[genetic load]] → sexual selection^[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235362665_The_Mating_Mind_How_Sexual_Choice_Shaped_the_Evolution_of_Human_Nature]
	1. **traits** that happen to reveal **mutation load** more **accurately** than other traits (e.g. through more complex development that requires the interaction of more genes) will tend to be **favored** in mate choice
		1. what about 'disguising' bad genes/traits? → (difficult thing to do, see: [[handicap principle]])

## fitness indicators
1. **[[human]] brains** make particularly good fitness indicators because their growth depends on about half the genes in the genome, thereby **summarizing a huge amount of information about mutation load**^[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235362665_The_Mating_Mind_How_Sexual_Choice_Shaped_the_Evolution_of_Human_Nature]
