1. [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] activated solely by a synthetic [[ligand (coordination chemistry)|ligand]] (RASSL) or designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugsÂ (DREADD); a class of artificially engineered protein receptors used in the field of chemogenetics which are selectively activated by certain ligands. They are used in biomedical research, in particular in [[neuroscience]] to manipulate the activity of [[neuron|neurons]].
   
   these systems typically utilize [[G protein-coupled receptor|G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)]] engineered to respond exclusively to synthetic ligands, like clozapine N-oxide (CNO), and not to endogenous ligands^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_activated_solely_by_a_synthetic_ligand]
