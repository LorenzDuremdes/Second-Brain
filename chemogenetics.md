1. chemogenetics; the process by which [[macromolecule|macromolecules]] can be engineered to interact with previously unrecognized small molecules. The engineered macromolecules used to design these receptors include nucleic acid hybrids, kinases, variety of metabolic enzymes, and [[G protein-coupled receptor|G-protein coupled receptors]] such as [[receptor activated solely by a synthetic ligand|DREADDs]].
   
   Chemogenetics has recently been favored over [[optogenetics]], and it avoids some of the challenges of optogenetics. Chemogenetics does not require the expensive light equipment, and therefore, is more accessible. The resolution in optogenetics declines due to light scattering and illuminance declined levels as the distance between the subject and the light source increases. These factors, therefore, donâ€™t allow for all cells to be affected by light and lead to a lower spatial resolution. Chemogenetics, however, does not require light usage and therefore can achieve a higher spatial resolution.[12]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemogenetics]
