## Milgram experiment
1. victim insisting the 'teacher' to continue · research telling 'teacher' to stop^[Influence, New and Expanded: The [[Psychology]] of [[Persuasion]], p. 11]
	1. the result couldn’t have been clearer; 100 percent of the subjects refused to give one additional shock when it was merely the fellow subject who demanded it
