1. direct gaze · [[autism]] → skin conductance responses
	1. Kaartinen et al. investigated the relationship between [[sympathetic nervous system|autonomic arousal]] to [[eye contact|direct gaze]] (measured by means of skin conductance responses) and [[social disorder|social impairment]] in ASD children (n = 15) and controls (n = 16). Among ASD children, but not among controls, a **positive association was found between impairment in [[social skills]] and increased arousal enhancement to direct gaze**.^[[Biological correlates of altered circadian rhythms, autonomic functions and sleep problems in autism spectrum disorder | Annals of General Psychiatry | Full Text (biomedcentral.com)](https://annals-general-psychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12991-022-00390-6#Sec10)]
