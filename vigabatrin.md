1. vigabatrin; a [[medication]] used in the management and treatment of infantile spasms and refractory complex partial seizures.
   
   It works by inhibiting the breakdown of [[γ-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA). It is also known as γ-vinyl-GABA, and is a structural analogue of GABA, but does not bind to GABA receptors.
   
   Vigabatrin is generally used only in cases of treatment-resistant [[epilepsy]] due to the risk of permanent vision loss. Although estimates of visual field loss vary substantially, risk appears to be lower among infants with treatment duration less than 12 months and the risk of clinically meaningful vision loss is very low among children treated for infantile spasms.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigabatrin]
