1. simulated annealing; a probabilistic technique for approximating the [[global optimum]] of a given function^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing]
	1. This notion of slow cooling implemented in the simulated annealing algorithm is interpreted as a slow decrease in the probability of accepting worse solutions as the solution space is explored
2. Simulated annealing searching for a maximum. The objective here is to get to the highest point. In this example, it is not enough to use a simple hill climb algorithm, as there are many local maxima. By cooling the temperature slowly the global maximum is found.^[By Kingpin13 - Own work, CC0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=25010763]

3. **relaxation time** (simulated annealing); depends on the "topography" of the energy function and on the current temperature^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing#Cooling_schedule]
