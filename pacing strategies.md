1. when is a fast start pacing strategy effective?
	1. for events shorter than 5 minutes^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 177]
2. what is the best pacing strategy according to the book "Cutting-Edge Cycling"?
	1. double peak
3. what pacing strategy reduces the rate at which you use carbohydrate as a fuel?
	1. negative split
		1. and limiting accumulation of fatigue-related metabolites, such as lactic [[acid]], early on in the exercise task.
5. cyclists who were provided no knowledge that they would be riding a 4-kilometer [[time trial]] and were given no feedback throughout improved their times exponentially with each performance, such that their performance was identical to the full-feedback group by the fourth [[time trial]]
	1. The rapid learning of a performance appears to occur even with longer time trials, in which day-to-day [[motivation]] and variability may be greater. A rapid plateau in performance occurred in 30K (Abbiss et al. 2008) and 40K time trials (Laursen et al. 2003) following a familiarization trial.^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 185]
6. Stable performance of a learned strategy is also difficult to disrupt e.g. when subjects were enticed with financial rewards for a faster performance (Hulleman et al. 2007).^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 185]
## J-curve pacing profile
1. J-curve pacing profile; we start out a bit harder than our sustainable workload and then drop below that workload for most of the event because of accumulated fatigue from the early effort (and likely from lack of focus and other psychological obstacles). Then we realize that the finish [[line]] is close and we still have a lot to give, so we try to make up for lost time by pushing hard during the final quarter or so of the event.
2. about five minutes normally passes before perceived exertion catches up to actual exertion, and by then it’s too late; having maintained too high a level for that time, you have little choice but to reduce your intensity and underperform.^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 174]

## double peak pacing strategy
1. double peak pacing strategy; a little above sustainable → sustainable → above sustainable (e.g. end sprint)
2. **double-peak pacing profile for a track pursuit**^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 176]
	1. ![[double-peak pacing profile for a track pursuit.jpg]]
3. how long to be above average sustainable power at the start of double peak?
	1. ~2 minutes^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 175]

# wind resistance strategies
1. in a tailwind, achieving even your FTP wattage is difficult^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, 181]
	1. typically, either your gearing is too small and you can’t spin the gear fast enough to compensate for the lower torque and resistance or you have a big enough gear but your muscles are not accustomed to producing high power when pedaling so rapidly (e.g. [[slow-twitch muscle fibers type I]])
2. headwind followed by tailwind → FTP
	1. above vs. below FTP (respectively)^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 179]
3. it could be best to ride with a tailwind home (not always most efficient mechanically)^[https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/average-speed-cycling/]
4. terrain → pacing strategy (wind resistance)
	1. try to cycle in open terrain when having tailwind and closed terrain when having headwind
		1. if unable to change terrains (e.g. same road(s)), try to cycle with the wind "neutral" (from the side)

# climbing strategies
1. flat → climb (FTP)
	1. below FTP at the flat segment, because you have less kinetic [[energy]] during the climb^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 179]
2. climbing (FTP)
	1. above average FTP (and below on the flats)^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 179]
3. factors determining uphill force distribution (FTP): uphill and downhill duration^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 184]
	1. e.g. less force uphill when downhill duration is shorter (less recovery)
	2. 1:1 ratio?

# tracking performance
1. why is pacing via [[heart]] rate inefficient?
	1. because it takes 30 seconds for the [[heart]] rate to respond to a hard effort
		1. you will be constantly raising and lowering your power to chase after a response that comes 30 seconds later
2. do you have to repeat a particular track to maintain performance on that track? ([[road cycling]])
	1. A delay of six weeks between efforts, however, resulted in a slower performance again (Abbiss et al.2008), suggesting a constant need to remind the body and [[human brain|brain]].^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 185]
