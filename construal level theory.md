1. [[fractal learning]] is from higher- to lower-level construals with exception of the subcomponent "hypothetical" and "informational"
	1. lower hypothetical distance → higher [[probability]] of occurrence
	2. lower informational distance → more pre-stored knowledge
2. "low construal level" leads to "further lowering of CLT?" e.g. cognitive biases
	1. **related** [[self-organized criticality]]

# deductive reasoning
1. deductive reasoning → construal level theory
	1. from abstraction to concreteness

# [[top-down]] approach
1. construal level theory · [[top-down]] approach = [[prioritization]]
	1. [[top-down]]
	2. [[prioritization]]

# [[bottom-up]]
1. why is it more difficult to detect danger that is "happening right in front of you"? (construal level theory)
	1. ◇lower-level construals → lower [[probability]] of connecting with the concept "danger"
	2. **related**: sample size
	3. **see also**: https://youtu.be/5n6lDNacfk0?t=4440, Alok Kanojia

# [[self-determination theory]]
1. construal level theory → [[motivation]] (e.g. girl)
	1. the lower the distance, the more it can motivate the other to interact with you (e.g. low hypothetical distance)

# [[knowledge quality]]
1. construal level theory → [[knowledge quality]]
	1. usually, the higher the CTL, the higher the [[knowledge quality]]
		1. e.g. can be connected (more easily) with other concepts

# [[entropy (information theory)]]
1. construal level theory → entropy ([[information]] theory)
	1. positive correlation
	2. could be relative? → e.g. dependent on [[goal]] → e.g. higher construals would increase [[learning rate]] → increase certainty → lower [[entropy]]
