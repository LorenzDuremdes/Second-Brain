1. receptor ([[biochemistry]]); chemical structures, composed of [[protein]], that receive and transduce signals that may be integrated into biological systems

2. These signals are typically chemical messengers which bind to a receptor and cause some form of cellular/tissue response, e.g. a change in the electrical activity of a [[cell]].

3. An example of [[membrane]] receptors.
Ligands, located outside the [[cell]]
Ligands connect to specific receptor proteins based on the shape of the active site of the [[protein]].

**The receptor releases a messenger once the ligand has connected to the receptor.**^[By Wyatt Pyzynski - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=69535544]

4. There are three main ways the action of the receptor can be classified: relay of signal, amplification, or integration. Relaying sends the signal onward, amplification increases the effect of a single ligand, and integration allows the signal to be incorporated into another biochemical pathway.
