1. functional threshold [[heart rate]]; the [[heart rate]] you can sustain for a one hour race effort
2. high correlation with [[functional threshold power|FTP]] (e.g. riding at FTP for an hours also results in measuring FTHR)?

# CTS field test
1. 2·8 minutes with 10 minutes rest^[https://support.trainerroad.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003912172-How-to-Test-with-the-20-Minute-8-Minute-FTP-Tests]
	1. FTHR=average HR·0.9 (same with "[[functional threshold power|FTP]]")
