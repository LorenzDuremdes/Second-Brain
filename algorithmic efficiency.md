1. algorithmic efficiency; a property of an [[algorithm]] which relates to the number of computational resources used by the [[algorithm]]
2. algorithmic efficiency → [[noise (spectral phenomenon)]]
	1. the less [[noise (spectral phenomenon)]] increases loss, the more efficient
		1. the more it can make use of [[noise (spectral phenomenon)]], the more efficient
			1. e.g. neuronal/synaptic [[noise (spectral phenomenon)]] (up till the optimal level)
# algorithmic efficiency → [[computer performance]]
1. a higher algorithmic efficiency would lead to a higher [[computer performance]]
