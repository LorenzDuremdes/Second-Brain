1. when to use "Auto HDR"?
	1. e.g. when taking a picture of something with a lot of light^[https://youtu.be/s2ruUomo77s?t=300]
2. D-Range Optimiser; tries to figure out which areas should be bright(er) or not from a single image^[https://youtu.be/s2ruUomo77s?t=330]
3. Metering mode → histogram (photography)
	1. e.g. spot measures the light in a selected spot (and reflecting that on the histogram)^[https://youtu.be/s2ruUomo77s?t=460]

## histogram
1. how bright or dark can you take a photo while still being able to edit its brightness afterward?
	1. ◇as long as the histogram doesn't show all/partially at being on one spot (e.g. extreme edges) with exception of rare cases e.g. something with a lot of the same color · brightness

## exposure value (EV)
1. what could cause being unable to adjust "EV" (Photo Pro ([[Sony Xperia]]))?
	1. EV is a measure of the total light exposed to the sensor during the exposure, so is the sum of all 3 settings. By changing the exposure compensation (+/- ev in intervals of 0.3), you are effectively telling the camera you want more or less total light than it's automatic meter is telling you. It will do this by adjusting whichever setting is not prioritised (eg shutter speed when in aperture priority mode).

		there is no exposure compensation in Manual mode, as you are not using the automatic metering.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/m54tp/comment/c2y639t/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]

## shutter speed
1. focal length → shutter speed
	1. a bigger focal length usually results in a higher optimal shutter speed^[https://youtu.be/Se1WzQLyldk?t=150]
		1. e.g. 200 mm · 1/600s
		2. less the case with e.g. a tripod

## aperture
1. a higher aperture can make focusing easier[https://youtu.be/Se1WzQLyldk?t=480]
	1. e.g. due to higher DoF
2. aperture → light
	1. a higher aperture enables less light to enter the camera^[https://www.google.com/search?client=opera-gx&q=higher+vs+lower+aperture+dark&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8]

## ISO
1. ISO; sensor sensitivity to light^[https://youtu.be/s2ruUomo77s?t=480]
2. ISO is usually done last^[https://youtu.be/Se1WzQLyldk?t=570]
3. what can happen when ISO is too low?
	1. missing details at darker areas
		1. can be compensated by either turning ISO higher (and lowering brightness with photo editing) or shutter speed slower

## design
1. Dual Pixel AutoFocus (DPAF); means that every single pixel on the camera’s sensor has two separate, light-sensitive photodiodes, each one hosting its own micro lens, capable of working together or individually^[https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/features/what-is-dual-pixel-af-and-why-is-it-important]
2. what could make a separate shutter button effective ([[Sony Xperia]] 1 III)?
	1. e.g. touching the screen doesn't always work with a screen protector^[https://youtu.be/CnTkheIe07w?t=240]

## criticism
https://www.instagram.com/p/DRal_ekDteO/ | **Simon d'Entremont**
I don’t like being critical, as I’d like to think my best role is lift people’s spirits and always encourage them to be their best. In photography, there’s is one place where I can’t say I’m a fan, and that’s in photography forums where the overwhelming direction is to seek perfection in photos. Tight portraits, perfect wing position, perfect light, direction of the subject is just right, no distractions, and clean and sterile backgrounds and surroundings. The result, in my view? All the photos look the same.

  
The bird in this photo is known for eating insects from the host animals, in this case buffalo, and flying around amongst the herd, giving you flight shot opportunities. I have photos of them between the buffalos with clean backgrounds and no animals or grass, but in my view this pic showing the buffalos (both in focus and out of focus in the back...which some would call a “distraction”) and environment in which they live makes for interesting additions...though not all would agree! What do you think? Yellow-billed oxpecker, Kenya.

[What taking 2 million photos has taught me about photography](https://youtu.be/EVLox4oiUs0?si=xZszJdoPlabe0la3&t=210) - "The best photographers don't see boring, they use their curiosity to see possibilties." "What if I am able to make magic of this average situation?" | being curious rather than judgmental (Simon d'Entremont)

[How do feel about photography all feeling very same-y these days?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhotography/comments/1phxejx/how_do_feel_about_photography_all_feeling_very/)  

- People on Reddit click on photos that are aesthetic. It’s just you see nice leading line, click. Nice silhouette, click. It’s pretty predictable, but that doesn’t represent that’s all that’s being created.
- If you look at photography contests, the major ones, I argue that there are still some pretty innovative and groundbreaking techniques and ideas out there. Just look at the Sony World Photography shortlist and finalists from this last cycle for instance. There’s a lot of photos in there that would NOT be upvoted a bunch here, like a series of photos on Tokyo public toilets, but are pretty significant in their own right.

"Stunning photographs are often boring photographs of stunning subjects. Everyone can make a nice sunset picture of a Golden Gate bridge. Only the best can make a nice picture of a boring street corner in the middle of the day."  

>I feel this is best highlighted when photography awards are announced and the comment sections around the web are filled with comments like "these are so boring". I use those opportunities to help me think of photography in a different way. I can't recall of a single Fan Ho image taken in an "iconic" location. Most of his work was created on streets most people simply walked past on a daily basis without a thought.

**[Why You Shouldn’t Give Too Much Weight to Anonymous Online Critics](https://petapixel.com/2011/07/13/why-you-shouldnt-give-too-much-weight-to-anonymous-online-critics/)**
Back in 2006, Flickr user [André Rabelo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrerabelo/) submitted [the above photograph](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrerabelo/70458366/) to the group pool of [DeleteMe!](http://www.flickr.com/groups/deleteme/), a group whose members vote on photos to weed out any photos that aren’t “incredible pictures, amazing, astonishing, perfect”. Sadly, the photograph was very quickly removed by popular vote.  

Here are some of the criticisms the voters had:

> When everything is blurred you cannot convey the motion of the bicyclist. On the other hand, if the bicyclist is not the subject– what was?

> Why is the staircase so “soft”? Camera shake? Like the angle though.

> so small. so blurry. to better show a sense of movement SOMETHING has to be in sharp focus

> Nicely composed, but blurry

> This looks contrived, which is not a bad thing. If this is a planned shot, it just didn’t come out right. If you can round up Mario, I would do it again. This time put the camera on a tripod and use the smallest aperture possible to get the best DoF. What I would hope for is that the railings are sharp and that mario on the bike shows a blur. Must have the foreground sharp, though. Without that, the image will never fly.

> yeah and? grey, blurry, small, odd crop

> bit too blurred to be worth a save from me

> Fantastic composition, but the tones and the graininess keep the photo from being great.

What’s funny about this story is that Rabelo had the last laugh — the photograph is actually “Hyeres, France, 1932”, a famous photograph by the French photographer and “father of modern photojournalism”, [Henri Cartier-Bresson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Cartier-Bresson). Made in 1932, the photo [sold at auction in 2008](http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5056705) for a whopping $265,000.

This just goes to show that you shouldn’t let anonymous online critics dictate how you photograph. While it’s great to receive feedback and certainly worthwhile to hear things that help you improve your technique, the criticisms you hear online are often from people who don’t know what they’re talking about, so don’t give _too_ much weight to negative comments!
