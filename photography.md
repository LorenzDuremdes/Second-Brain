1. when to use "Auto HDR"?
	1. e.g. when taking a picture of something with a lot of light^[https://youtu.be/s2ruUomo77s?t=300]
2. D-Range Optimiser; tries to figure out which areas should be bright(er) or not from a single image^[https://youtu.be/s2ruUomo77s?t=330]
3. Metering mode → histogram (photography)
	1. e.g. spot measures the light in a selected spot (and reflecting that on the histogram)^[https://youtu.be/s2ruUomo77s?t=460]

## histogram
1. how bright or dark can you take a photo while still being able to edit its brightness afterward?
	1. ◇as long as the histogram doesn't show all/partially at being on one spot (e.g. extreme edges) with exception of rare cases e.g. something with a lot of the same color · brightness

## exposure value (EV)
1. what could cause being unable to adjust "EV" (Photo Pro (Sony Xperia))?
	1. EV is a measure of the total light exposed to the sensor during the exposure, so is the sum of all 3 settings. By changing the exposure compensation (+/- ev in intervals of 0.3), you are effectively telling the camera you want more or less total light than it's automatic meter is telling you. It will do this by adjusting whichever setting is not prioritised (eg shutter speed when in aperture priority mode).

		there is no exposure compensation in Manual mode, as you are not using the automatic metering.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/m54tp/comment/c2y639t/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]

## shutter speed
1. focal length → shutter speed
	1. a bigger focal length usually results in a higher optimal shutter speed^[https://youtu.be/Se1WzQLyldk?t=150]
		1. e.g. 200 mm · 1/600s
		2. less the case with e.g. a tripod

## aperture
1. a higher aperture can make focusing easier[https://youtu.be/Se1WzQLyldk?t=480]
	1. e.g. due to higher DoF
2. aperture → light
	1. a higher aperture enables less light to enter the camera^[https://www.google.com/search?client=opera-gx&q=higher+vs+lower+aperture+dark&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8]

## ISO
1. ISO; sensor sensitivity to light^[https://youtu.be/s2ruUomo77s?t=480]
2. ISO is usually done last^[https://youtu.be/Se1WzQLyldk?t=570]
3. what can happen when ISO is too low?
	1. missing details at darker areas
		1. can be compensated by either turning ISO higher (and lowering brightness with photo editing) or shutter speed slower

## design
1. Dual Pixel AutoFocus (DPAF); means that every single pixel on the camera’s sensor has two separate, light-sensitive photodiodes, each one hosting its own micro lens, capable of working together or individually^[https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/features/what-is-dual-pixel-af-and-why-is-it-important]
2. what could make a separate shutter button effective (Sony Xperia 1 III)?
	1. e.g. touching the screen doesn't always work with a screen protector^[https://youtu.be/CnTkheIe07w?t=240]
