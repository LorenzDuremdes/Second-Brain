# Filippo Ganna (2022)
## [[cycling biomechanics]]
1. Filippo Ganna (2022 hour record) > cadence ≈ 98 average RPM
	1. Ganna was running 170mm Wattshop Cratus aero cranks – Wattshop being Bigham's own aero componentry company – with a 64-tooth chainring. This was be paired with a 14-tooth rear cog from the same Wattshop Cratus range.
	   
	   Connecting the two was an Izumi KAI chain, for a total drivetrain cost of around £1,100.00 (€1,250). The entire drivetrain will receive a special low-friction coating from British brand Muc-Off.
	   
	   With this gear, Ganna needed to average a cadence of at least 96 RPM to break the record. **In fact, a perfect cadence of 96RPM would have netted Ganna a distance of 55.570km. However, that was assuming he rides perfectly on the black line for the entire hour. Hitting his mark of 56.792km, Ganna would have had to average over 98RPM.**
	   
	   **Bigham indicated that Ganna would follow suit in looking to ride a [[negative split]], going conservatively - and at lower cadence - in the first half before lifting the pace in the back end.**^[[€75k per hour – Filippo Ganna's full gear and kit list for his Hour Record attempt | Cyclingnews](https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/euro75k-per-hour-filippo-gannas-full-gear-and-kit-list-for-his-hour-record-attempt/)]
	   2. Watts and CdA aside for a second, Ganna suggested in today’s press conference that he may ride with a 66 x 14 gearing and he would target a cadence of 96rpm^[[Hour Record: How to watch and how far Ganna will go - Velo (outsideonline.com)](https://velo.outsideonline.com/road/road-racing/hour-record-how-to-watch-and-how-far-ganna-will-go/)]

1. Daniel Bigham > tyre width (hour record) = 23 mm front and 25 mm rear^[[The Hour record and aerodynamics with Dan Bigham | EP#368 (scientifictriathlon.com)](https://scientifictriathlon.com/tts368/)]
	- A narrow tire is more aerodynamic, but measuring tire width varies depending on the tire type and the rim width.
	- On the whole, having a narrower tire at the front will outperform a wider tire because of aerodynamics and despite the increase in rolling resistance.

1. a smaller Q-factor to improve CdA^[https://youtu.be/LzJUDSy3DDI?t=650]
	1. the 8.5 mm Q-factor reduction equates to a “rider-dependent saving of 0.0009 to 0.0017 m2,” or, in more relatable terms, a 1.5-3 W saving at 50 km/h and a 3-5 W saving at 60 km/h (“assuming a standard air density of 1.225 kg/m3“)^[https://escapecollective.com/mid-90s-aero-is-still-fast-today-the-five-watt-aero-gain-in-narrower-q-factors/]

# [[physiology]]
1. _the body responds to how it perceives it to be and not how it is. If you feel cooler, you will behave accordingly_
   
   The statement "The body responds to how it perceives it to be and not how it is. If you feel cooler, you will behave accordingly" draws from the principles of thermal perception and physiological [[psychology]]. It underlines the significance of subjective perception of temperature on physical performance and behavior, rather than the objective temperature itself. This is particularly relevant in sports and exercise contexts, where thermal comfort can influence performance, [[pacing strategies]], and overall effort.
   
   The psychological aspect of feeling cooler can lead to improved performance or endurance because the individual believes they are in a more favorable condition to perform. This perception can be influenced by various factors, such as pre-cooling strategies, the use of menthol, or even the belief that one's actions (like consuming ice) are effective at reducing core temperature. These strategies do not necessarily have to lower core temperature significantly to be effective; the perception of being cooler can be enough to alter behavior and potentially improve performance.
   
   From a physiological standpoint, the body's thermal regulation involves complex interactions between the [[central nervous system]] and the skin, muscles, and [[circulatory system]]. When the [[brain]] perceives that the body is cool, it can lead to adjustments in [[blood]] flow, sweating rates, and metabolic heat production, which can influence physical performance and comfort levels.
   
   Dan Bigham's discussion of his approach to the Hour Record highlights the importance of optimizing every possible aspect of performance, including how the perception of heat and cooling can be leveraged to enhance physical output. His use of pre-cooling strategies and efforts to keep his core temperature in check illustrate a holistic approach to performance [[engineering]], where psychological comfort and physiological [[optimization]] are both considered crucial to achieving peak performance.^[GPT-4]
