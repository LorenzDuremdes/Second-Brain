1. differential equation; an equation that relates one or more functions and their derivatives
	1. In applications, the functions generally represent physical quantities, the derivatives represent their rates of change, and the differential equation defines a relationship between the two.

Such relations are common; therefore, differential equations play a prominent role in many disciplines including engineering, [[physics]], economics, and [[biology]].

2. Visualization of heat transfer in a pump casing, created by solving the heat equation. Heat is being generated internally in the casing and being cooled at the boundary, providing a [[steady state]] temperature distribution.
