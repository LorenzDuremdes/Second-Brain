2. The addition of [[water]] vapor to air (making the air humid) reduces the density of the air, which may at first appear counter-intuitive. This occurs because the molar mass of [[water]] vapor (18 g/mol) is less than the molar mass of dry air[note 2] (around 29 g/mol). For any ideal gas, at a given temperature and pressure, the number of molecules is constant for a particular volume (see [[Avogadro's Law]]). So when [[water]] molecules ([[water]] vapor) are added to a given volume of air, the dry air molecules must decrease by the same number, to keep the pressure or temperature from increasing. Hence the mass per unit volume of the gas (its density) decreases.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_of_air#Humid_air]
