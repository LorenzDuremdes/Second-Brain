1. FTP is a surrogate of MLSS
2. In a tailwind, achieving even your FTP wattage is difficult.
	1. Typically, either your gearing is too small and you can’t [[bicycle pedal|spin the gear]] fast enough to compensate for the lower torque and resistance or you have a big enough gear but your [[skeletal muscle|muscles]] are not accustomed to producing high power when pedaling so rapidly^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 181]
3. how many (active) rest days does Joe Friel recommend before doing an FTP and FTHR test?
	1. 3–5^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 18]
4. [[anaerobic capacity]] is lower than FTP?
	1. [[anaerobic capacity]] → point where you start producing significant [[lactic acid]]
	2. FTP → a little above [[anaerobic capacity]] (e.g. you can afford some [[lactic acid]] for an hour)?

# FTP test
## CTS field test
1. 2·8 minutes with 10 minutes rest^[https://support.trainerroad.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003912172-How-to-Test-with-the-20-Minute-8-Minute-FTP-Tests]
	1. FTP=average watts·0.9 (same with "[[functional threshold heart rate|FTHR]]")

# improvements besides FTP
1. FTP can stay flat but you can make huge improvements everywhere else^[https://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/w93xtn/comment/iht4ilf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
2. [[stamina (endurance)]]
3. e.g. [[fatigue resistance (road cycling)]], [[chronic training load]]
4. e.g. W/kg / [[aerodynamics (road cycling)|W/CdA]], [[sprint (road cycling)]], [[anaerobic capacity]]
5. e.g. [[sleep]], [[nutrition (road cycling)]], [[psychological stress]]
6. [[stimulus-to-fatigue ratio]] e.g. [[blood flow restriction training]]
