1. In a tailwind, achieving even your FTP wattage is difficult.
	1. Typically, either your gearing is too small and you can’t [[bicycle pedal|spin the gear]] fast enough to compensate for the lower torque and resistance or you have a big enough gear but your [[skeletal muscle|muscles]] are not accustomed to producing high power when pedaling so rapidly^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 181]
2. how many (active) rest days does Joe Friel recommend before doing an FTP and FTHR test?
	1. 3–5^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 18]
3. [[anaerobic threshold]] is lower than FTP?
	1. [[anaerobic threshold]] → point where you start producing significant [[lactic acid]]
	2. FTP → a little above [[anaerobic threshold]] (e.g. you can afford some [[lactic acid]] for an hour)?

# FTP test
## CTS field test
1. 2·8 minutes with 10 minutes rest^[https://support.trainerroad.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003912172-How-to-Test-with-the-20-Minute-8-Minute-FTP-Tests]
	1. FTP=average watts·0.9
