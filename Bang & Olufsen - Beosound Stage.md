1. 

## comparison
1. I moved from a complete Dolby Atmos hometheater setup. Klipsch RP-600M fronts, 500M surrounds, 500SA atmos modules, REL HT/1003 sub, Sony STR-DN1080 / Pioneer VSX-932 amp.
   
   Not going back. The Stage sounds better, looks better and there are less wires involved. The base is strong as well, not room shaking like with the REL, but more gut punching.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/BangandOlufsen/comments/yzmu0k/comment/ix3wthc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]
