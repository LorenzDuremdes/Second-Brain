1. overhead ([[computer science|computing]]); any combination of excess or indirect computation time, memory, bandwidth, or other resources that are required to perform a specific task^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_(computing)]
2. It's the resources required to set up an operation. It might seem unrelated, but necessary.^[https://stackoverflow.com/a/2860263]

  

	It's like when you need to go somewhere, you might need a car. But, it would be a lot of overhead to get a car to drive down the street, so you might want to walk. However, the overhead would be worth it if you were going across the country.

  

	In [[computer science]], sometimes we use cars to go down the street because we don't have a better way, or it's not worth our time to "learn how to walk".
