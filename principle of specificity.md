1. principle of specificity 2 main subcomponents:^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 15]
	1. central
	2. peripheral
2. "peripheral" is a [[construal level theory|lower-level construal]] than "central" (principle of specificity)

# [[sports science (cycling)]]
1. why is 'doing the exact event' to follow the principle of specificity perhaps suboptimal?
	1. it might be better to allocate most of the TSS budget toward the bottlenecks and the remainder to the rest of the goal (e.g. the latter can have [[diminishing returns]])
		1. same as how it's faster to allocate more energy toward hills/headwind
# central
1. primarily occur in the [[heart]], [[lungs]], and [[blood]]^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 15]
	1. It doesn’t make much difference which endurance [[sport]] you participate in for these changes to happen. The heart, for example, doesn’t know the difference between running and [[road cycling|cycling]]. It simply pumps [[oxygen]]-rich blood regardless of what type of exercise is being done.

# peripheral
1. [[skeletal muscle|quadriceps]] are more related to "peripheral (principle of specificity)"^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 15]
	1. e.g. it responds differently between running and cycling

# [[sports periodization]]
1. periodization tends to usually be from central to peripheral (principle of specificity)^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 15]
