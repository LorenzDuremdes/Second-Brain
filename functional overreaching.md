1. requirement for functional overreaching
	1. sufficient recovery after overtraining to allow further [[progressive overload]]^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, 132]
		1. e.g. deload week after â†‘MRV last microcycle of a [[mesocycle]]
	2. not too much muscle damage --> preventing [[deconditioning (fitness)|detraining]] while still recovering
