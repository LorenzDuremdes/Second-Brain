1. requirement for functional overreaching
	1. sufficient recovery after overtraining to allow further [[progressive overload]]^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, 132]
		1. e.g. deload week after ↑MRV last [[microcycle]] of a [[mesocycle]]
	2. not too much muscle damage --> preventing [[deconditioning (fitness)|detraining]] while still recovering
2. normal [[progressive overload]] + (non)functional overreaching

3. how long does functional overreaching recovery usually last?
	1. usually a week^[Cutting-Edge Cycling, p. 132]
		1. beyond might cause [[nonfunctional overreaching]] (detraining while still recovering)
