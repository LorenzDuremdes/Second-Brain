|------------ |---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---|
|     Low     | 1st phase of stable performance |  15–20% of maximal duration until clear fatigue | Maintaining exercise performance and accelerated recovery | Enhances |
|   Moderate  | 2nd phase of stable performance |  20–60% of maximal duration until clear fatigue |              Maintaining exercise performance             |  <24h
| Sub-maximal |   Phase of compensated fatigue  |  60–75% of maximal duration until clear fatigue |    Stabilization and moderate increases in performance    | ~24h
|   Maximal   |      Phase of clear fatigue     | 75–100% of maximal duration until clear fatigue |             Distinct increases in performance             | >48h

1. what do you usually like to think when feeling very fatigued and having to do a zone 2 workout?
	1. that this fatigue makes the adaptations even bigger (e.g. [[Henneman's size principle]], [[fatigue resistance (road cycling)|fatigue resistance]], [[principle of specificity]])
