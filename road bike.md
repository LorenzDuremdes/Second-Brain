# [[bike fit]]
1. when does Joe Friel recommend to get a [[bike fit]] for optimal performance + why^[The Cyclist's Training Bible, p. 18]
	1. every season, because e.g. flexibility changed
	2. You should have a [[bike fit]] every season, even if you are riding the same bike you were properly fitted to last season. Things change. You gain or lose muscle strength, flexibility, or mass, and your range of motion changes due to aging, strength training, and changes in training workloads. Or you may have changed your saddle, handlebar stem, pedals, shoes, or something else from the previous season. Or the types of races you’re doing this coming season are different from last year’s. Or you have minor but niggling knee tenderness.
