# [[psychotherapy]]
1. does the patient have to talk during EMDR for it to be effective?^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 295]
	1. no
2. does the patient have to trust their psychotherapist for EMDR to be effective?^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 295]
	1. no (why?) → can especially be useful for patients with e.g. [[psychological trauma]] who tend to distrust others

# mechanism
1. how could EMDR be a misnomer?^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 298]
	1. it might allow for *integration* (of [[psychological trauma]]) rather than desensitization
		1. depends on what you desensitize (e.g. physiological reactivity)
2. EMDR → [[orienting response]]
	1. horizontal eye movement triggers an evolutionary '[[orienting response]]' in the [[brain]], used in scanning the environment for threats and opportunities.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_desensitization_and_reprocessing#cite_note-Jeffries_&_Davis_2012-77]
3. EMDR · sleep
	1. EMDR gives an effect similar to the effects of sleep,^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_desensitization_and_reprocessing#cite_note-78] and posit that traumatic experiences are processed during sleep
		1. probably more related to "REM sleep"
4. EMDR · mindfulness
	1. trauma can be overcome or mastered, and EMDR facilitates a form of mindfulness or other form of mastery over the trauma.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_desensitization_and_reprocessing#cite_note-Logie2014-47]

# neuropsychology
1. EMDR → creativity^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma]
	1. the former can increase the latter
		1. **related**: [[REM sleep]]

# neurophysiology
1. EMDR → prefrontal lobe^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 296]
	1. former increases activity in the latter
2. EMDR → anterior cingulate^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 296]
	1. the former increases activity in the latter
3. EMDR → basal ganglia^[The Body Keeps the Score: [[Brain]], [[Mind]], and Body in the Healing of Trauma, p. 296]
	1. the former increases activity in the latter

# history
1. eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (history); she (Francine Shapiro) further noted that her [[anxiety]] was reduced when she brought her eye movements under voluntary control while thinking a traumatic thought^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_desensitization_and_reprocessing#History]
