1. [[sleep]] state misperception; a term in the International Classification of [[Sleep]] Disorders (ICSD) most commonly used for people who mistakenly perceive their [[sleep]] as wakefulness, though it has been proposed that it be applied to those who severely overestimate their [[total sleep time|sleep time]] as well
2. [[sleep]] state misperception ([[neuropsychology]])
	1. According to a May 2014 article published in New Scientist, spectral analysis may help clinicians find objective evidence for [[sleep]] state misperception: [...] it uncovered [...] subtle differences in the EEGs of sleeping insomniacs: alpha waves – signatures of wakefulness that are supposed to show up only in early [[sleep]] – were intruding into [[slow-wave sleep|deep sleep]]. [...] [psychologist and sleep researcher Michael] Perlis. But Andrew Krystal of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, used spectral analysis to quantify just how much they were intruding. Krystal's non-sleepers not only had a greater proportion of these alpha disturbances, but the alpha waves were bigger and the delta waves were correspondingly smaller. That wasn't all. When Perlis and other researchers applied spectral analysis algorithms to the EEGs of their sleeping insomniacs, they found different patterns, fast waves known as beta and gamma ([[Sleep]], vol 24, p 110). Normally, these are indicators of [[consciousness]], alertness and even [[anxiety]] [...] Like alpha waves, Perlis calls these beta and gamma waves "intrusions" into normal [[sleep]]: "It's as if somebody is playing with the switch – boop, boop – flipping at a mad rate between wake and [[sleep]]".[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_state_misperception]^[[[tt] NS 2969: Awake asleep: Insomniac brains that can't switch off (archive.org)](https://web.archive.org/web/20140909170531/http://postbiota.org/pipermail/tt/2014-May/015444.html)]
