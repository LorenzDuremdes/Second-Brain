# [[pacing strategies]]
1. how could you perhaps prevent getting dropped ascending (group rides ([[road cycling]]))?
	1. go a bit more to the front/faster on the flat (and be more aerodynamic) and go a little easier on the climb^[https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/getting-dropped-why-it-happens-and-how-to-prevent-it/]
		1. reducing/shortening the peaks
2. is it effective to also increase watts when the rest do it as well (peloton ([[road cycling]]) + why?
	1. perhaps not. you should try to stay at the front and slowly move backward in the peloton followed by slowly moving forward to e.g. conserve [[glycogen]]^[https://youtu.be/HvS4qrjdD-c?t=1740]

## tactics
1. why shouldn't you accelerate when taking a pull (paceline < cycling)?
	1. to avoid creating surges (for those behind you recovering)
	   
	   When the person in front of you rotates off, do not accelerate. New riders are especially guilty of this, and it’s typically not intentional. When you pull through, you’ve had the longest rest in the group, you’re feeling strong, and you don’t want to look like the weak rider. The best way to ensure a steady change is to stay in the same gear and keep an eye on your cadence (or use [[speed]]). This should become habit, but the first few times you focus on it you may be amazed at your tendency to [[speed]] up when you pull through. In a [[team time trial]], the surge will only hurt your teammates and break the rhythm. In a breakaway with opponents, you’re only doing more work than others and should be saving that [[energy]] for one big surge to get away later. Don’t waste it while they’re drafting you. Example: I was recently riding with a guy new on our team. I was riding at 300 watts, and when he pulled through I was doing 420w just to hold on his wheel, but after about 15 seconds I could return to 300w and cruise right by him. The bottom line is that surging like this tends to slow the group down, despite the momentary increase in [[speed]].^[https://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/18tjl4/tactics_series_entry_2_pacelines/]
2. **how** should you latch onto the back of the peloton after it was your turn to pull?
	1. Start accelerating before you’re at the back. You just pulled off and you’re tired; the last thing you want is to miss the tail end of the group and chase back through the wind. You should know how many riders are in your paceline and count them as you drift back. Shift to a higher gear with one or two riders to go and return to the group’s [[speed]] to get on the back of the line.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/18tjl4/tactics_series_entry_2_pacelines/]
3. what concept in [[physics]] matters most in peloton tactics (e.g. [[Belgischer Kreisel]])?
	1. [[conservation of energy]] e.g. not trying to accelerate hard when taking a pull or starting to accelerate too late when latching on again in the back

1. [What’s your towns “fast” group ride like?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/ny5aze/whats_your_towns_fast_group_ride_like/)
	1. Not really my towns fast ride, but some of my colleagues who ride together with other people they know also.
	   
	   Their normal training rides are 80-100k at ~35km/h or something.
	   
	   Also today some of them did a 100km event at 43km/h, one of them did 304 watt average over 2h19m...
	   
	   It was like 40 meters of elevation, so basically pancake flat. But still, mad average speed!
