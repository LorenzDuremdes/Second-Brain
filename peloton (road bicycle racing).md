# [[pacing strategies]]
1. how could you perhaps prevent getting dropped ascending (group rides ([[road cycling]]))?
	1. go a bit more to the front/faster on the flat (and be more aerodynamic) and go a little easier on the climb^[https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/getting-dropped-why-it-happens-and-how-to-prevent-it/]
		1. reducing/shortening the peaks
2. is it effective to also increase watts when the rest do it as well (peloton ([[road cycling]]) + why?
	1. perhaps not. you should try to stay at the front and slowly move backward in the peloton followed by slowly moving forward to e.g. conserve [[glycogen]]^[https://youtu.be/HvS4qrjdD-c?t=1740]
