1. c tactile afferents; nerve receptors in mammalian skin that generally respond to nonpainful stimulation such as light touch^phttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_tactile_afferent
	1. as group C nerve fibers, they are unmyelinated and have slow conduction velocities

# biopsychology
2. In humans, these CTs have always been linked to pleasant touch behavior and are most responsive during slow gentle stroking of a brush with the velocity of 3 cm/s.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_tactile_afferent#cite_note-:4-14] CT neurons project to the [[insular cortex]] in the [[brain]],^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_tactile_afferent#cite_note-15]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_tactile_afferent#cite_note-16] and the firing frequency of CT neurons correlate with perceived pleasantness of skin stroking.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_tactile_afferent#cite_note-:4-14]
