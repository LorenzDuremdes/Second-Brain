1. [[lactate]] threshold (average) = 85% of maximum [[heart rate]] or 75% of [[VO2 max|maximum oxygen intake]]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_threshold#cite_note-:0-2]
2. [[lactate]] threshold is more malleable
	1. an untrained athlete could conceivably double his or her power at [[lactate]] threshold but would not be able to raise a starting VO2max of 40 ml/kg/min. all the way to 80 unless he or she was born with the genetics to have a VO2max of 80 ml/kg/min^[The Time-Crunched Cyclist: Race-Winning Fitness in 6 Hours a Week, 3rd Edition, p. 13]

# [[physiology]]
1. why is [[lactate]] testing not as reliable?
	1. No way.
	   
	   As with other physiological determinants of performance (e.g., VO2max), maximal metabolic [[steady state]] (for which FTP is a surrogate) is subject to both day-to-day variability as well as longer-term changes due to, e.g., training. Nonetheless, as with VO2max, such variability is quite small, i.e., only a couple percent.* You should therefore be able to readily determine your FTP to the nearest 5 W. If you can’t/aren’t at least that confident in your estimate, you should revisit your test protocol and/or question your equipment.
	   
	   *This is partially where people go wrong in holding up [[lactate]] testing as the “gold standard”, as in fact it is more, not less, variable than just measuring performance.*^[https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/comparing-actual-ftp-test-to-the-ai-ftp-detection-feature/71200/175?u=lorenz_duremdes, Dr. Andrew Coggan]

	1. higher muscle [[glycogen]] increases [[lactate]] concentration (even at rest, but to a lesser degree)^[Dr. Andrew Coggan: https://www.trainerroad.com/forum/t/lactate-testing-data-and-results/6484/546?u=lorenz_duremdes]
