1. [[lactate]] threshold (average) = 85% of maximum [[heart rate]] or 75% of [[VO2 max|maximum oxygen intake]]^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactate_threshold#cite_note-:0-2]
2. [[lactate]] threshold is more malleable
	1. an untrained athlete could conceivably double his or her power at [[lactate]] threshold but would not be able to raise a starting VO2max of 40 ml/kg/min. all the way to 80 unless he or she was born with the genetics to have a VO2max of 80 ml/kg/min^[The Time-Crunched Cyclist: Race-Winning Fitness in 6 Hours a Week, 3rd Edition, p. 13]

# 3-zone model
1. LT1; sustained increase in [[blood]] [[lactate]] concentration above resting values^[https://www.lboro.ac.uk/sport/news/2020/april/training-zones/]
2. LT2; indicating the upper limit of equilibrium between [[lactate]] production and clearance^[https://www.lboro.ac.uk/sport/news/2020/april/training-zones/]

# [[physiology]]
1. MCT-1;Â takes [[lactate]] inside slow-twitch muscle fibers^[https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/what-is-lactate-and-lactate-threshold/]
2. MCT-4; might be especially appropriate for export of [[lactate]] derived from glycolysis^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocarboxylate_transporter_4]
