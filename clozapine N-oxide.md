1. [[clozapine]] _N_-oxide; a synthetic [[drug]] used mainly in biomedical research as a [[ligand (coordination chemistry)|ligand]] to activate [[receptor activated solely by a synthetic ligand|DREADD receptors]]. Although it was initially believed to be biologically inert. However, it has been shown not to enter the brain after administration and to reverse metabolise in peripheral tissues to form clozapine. Clozapine can bind to a number of different [[5-HT receptor|serotonergic]], [[dopaminergic neuron|dopaminergic]] and [[adrenergic receptor|adrenergic receptors]] within the [[brain]]. Therefore, behavioural data using the CNO-DREADD system in [[neuroscience]] experiments have to be interpreted with caution.
