   So here‚Äôs my take, (which I haven‚Äôt seen anyone else mention yet, and I should really rewatch the movie to confirm) and it‚Äôs that the reason for all the added pressure and is that the Archive company in the real world does not currently have a way to transfer the consciousness and/or keep it from degrading. So, I thought they essentially put him in a customized simulation to use him to continue working on the job he was hired to do before he died. And as he is actually in the Archive, there‚Äôs only a limited amount of time for the company to ‚Äúpick his brain‚Äù so to speak, again more pressure to complete the project on time. J1 and J2 were part of the natural progression of his development of the technology, but the real company knew, which is partially why they (Toby Jones and pals) came in and did the ‚Äúrisk assessment.‚Äù I think the phone calls with his wife were real, which is why he mentions being frustrated that he could never call out, and only she could call him. I‚Äôm not sure I explained my theory quite as well as I could have, but I‚Äôm gonna stop typing and go watch it again üòù
	1. Ah, this is similar to what I thought. I am going to jump around here with spoilers (key note in the end): So he died in the car accident, the Company funded his archive because they wanted his work to continue. He didn't realize that his consciousness was in the simulation/kept in suspension until the end (kept in the dark by the company in order to expedite his work). You see signs that he is in the simulation early on because he cannot ever call out (to the real world) and there are more disruptions in the compound (because his archive is aging and nearing termination). The company that developed the Archive unit is different than the company he works for, and they eventually learn the existence of J2 thinking that they have struck gold (when J2 dies and is later "found/pulled out of the lake" by the Archive company). So in the real world, the company he works for and the Archive company are competing against one another to obtain the intellectual property of J2's AI. But the last scene where J3 talks to his wife is a crucial moment: ***He successfully developed a working AI inside the digital confines of his Archive. In the final scene, his wife is actually speaking to the AI that he created.*** Because he believed that his wife was the one who died (instead of himself) he tries uploading her archived consciousness into J3 but is unsuccessful because her "archive" didn't actually exist or contain anything and was just a manifestation of his memories of her. Earlier on he talks about how he converted analog memories to digital in order to make a framework for J3's AI.
