1. predictive coding; a comparison between predictions (priors) and sensory input (likelihood) yields a difference measure (e.g. prediction error, free energy, or surprise) which, if it is sufficiently large beyond the levels of expected statistical noise, will cause the generative model to update so that it better predicts sensory input in the future^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_coding]
	1. if, instead, the model accurately predicts driving sensory signals, activity at higher levels cancels out activity at lower levels, and the posterior [[probability]] of the model is increased
